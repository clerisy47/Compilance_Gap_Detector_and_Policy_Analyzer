Test Output:
**Requirement:** This policy requires data to be encrypted at rest.

**Evaluation:**

Given the evidence, I conclude that the requirement is **Not Satisfied**. The reason is that while the system supports encryption for stored data, it does not explicitly state that data is being encrypted at rest, which is a specific condition stated in the policy.
