Requirement: Rapidly identify, contain, and mitigate the effects of security incidents to minimize operational disruption and potential damage to systems and data.

Result: Not Satisfied

Explanation:  The evidence describes determining relevant internal and external issues impacting the information security management system (ISMS). This relates to general risk management and the context of the ISMS, not the specific requirement of *rapid* incident response and mitigation.  While a well-defined ISMS *contributes* to incident response capability, the evidence doesn't demonstrate the rapid identification, containment, and mitigation aspects.

Requirement: A dedicated committee comprising key stakeholders from various departments will oversee the implementation and ongoing management of the information security program.

Result: Not Satisfied

Explanation:  The provided evidence outlines steps to identify and address stakeholder requirements for the information security management system (ISMS). It does *not* confirm the existence of a dedicated committee overseeing the ISMS implementation and management as required.  While identifying stakeholder requirements is a necessary step, it doesn't inherently fulfill the requirement of a dedicated oversight committee.

Requirement: Identify security and compliance requirements.

Result: Satisfied

Explanation: The provided evidence explicitly states that the organization shall determine the applicability of the information security management system and consider external and internal issues, and specified requirements.  This demonstrates a process for identifying security and compliance requirements.  While Passages 2 and 3 describe risk management and governance, Passage 2 also mentions identifying and assessing risks related to information security which is related to identifying security requirements.

Requirement: A dedicated committee comprising key stakeholders from various departments will oversee the implementation and ongoing management of the information security program.

Result: Not Satisfied

Explanation: The provided evidence describes the establishment and maintenance of an ISMS, which, while a crucial part of a robust security program, doesn't explicitly confirm the existence of a dedicated committee overseeing its implementation and management as required.  The evidence focuses on the *system* itself, not the *oversight* of the system.
