**Requirement**:

 A business that controls the collection of a consumer's personal information shall, at or before the point of collection, inform consumers of the following:
(1) The categories of personal information to be collected and the purposes for which the categories of personal information are collected or used and whether that information is sold or shared. A business shall not collect additional categories of personal information or use personal information collected for additional purposes that are incompatible with the disclosed purpose for which the personal information was collected without providing the consumer with notice consistent with this section.
(2) If the business collects sensitive personal information, the categories of sensitive personal information to be collected and the purposes for which the categories of sensitive personal information are collected or used, and whether that information is sold or shared. A business shall not collect additional categories of sensitive personal information or use sensitive personal information collected for additional purposes that are incompatible with the disclosed purpose for which the sensitive personal information was collected without providing the consumer with notice consistent with this section.
(3) The length of time the business intends to retain each category of personal information, including sensitive personal information, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period provided that a business shall not retain a consumer's personal information or sensitive personal information for each disclosed purpose for which the personal information was collected for longer than is reasonably necessary for that disclosed purpose. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 A business that, acting as a third party, controls the collection of personal information about a consumer may satisfy its obligation under subdivision (a) by providing the required information prominently and conspicuously on the homepage of its internet website. In addition, if a business acting as a third party controls the collection of personal information about a consumer on its premises, including in a vehicle, then the business shall, at or before the point of collection, inform consumers as to the categories of personal information to be collected and the purposes for which the categories of personal information are used, and whether that personal information is sold, in a clear and conspicuous manner at the location. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 A business' collection, use, retention, and sharing of a consumer's personal information shall be reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purposes for which the personal information was collected or processed, or for another disclosed purpose that is compatible with the context in which the personal information was collected, and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

A business that collects a consumer's personal information and that sells that personal information to, or shares it with, a third party or that discloses it to a service provider or contractor for a business purpose shall enter into an agreement with the third party, service provider, or contractor, that:

(1) Specifies that the personal information is sold or disclosed by the business only for limited and specified purposes.
(2) Obligates the third party, service provider, or contractor to comply with applicable obligations under this title and obligate those persons to provide the same level of privacy protection as is required by this title.
(3) Grants the business rights to take reasonable and appropriate steps to help ensure that the third party, service provider, or contractor uses the personal information transferred in a manner consistent with the business' obligations under this title.
(4) Requires the third party, service provider, or contractor to notify the business if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligations under this title.
(5) Grants the business the right, upon notice, including under paragraph (4), to take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized use of personal information.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The evidence only shows that contracts with third-party service providers include provisions for encryption and data protection in alignment with a policy. This does not necessarily mean that the agreements specify that the personal information is sold or disclosed by the business only for limited and specified purposes (requirement 1).
* While the presence of privacy protection requirements (requirements 2-5) is noted, it is unclear if these requirements are comprehensive enough to ensure compliance with applicable obligations under this title.
* The evidence does not explicitly confirm that all identified requirements will be addressed through the information security management system.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Contracts with third-party service providers must include provisions for encryption 
and data protection in alignment with this policy.




**Requirement**:
A business that collects a consumer's personal information shall implement reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the personal information to protect the personal information from unauthorized or illegal access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure in accordance with Section 1798.81.5.

**Status**: 
Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 
The requirement is not satisfied because, although the evidence mentions "security controls and practices designed to protect sensitive data", it does not explicitly state that these measures are reasonable given the nature of the personal information being collected. The language used in the regulation emphasizes the need for "reasonable" security procedures, which implies a level of proportionality and adequacy to the type of personal information being handled.

**Target Policy**: It outlines the security controls and 
practices designed to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with legal, 
regulatory, and contractual obligations.




**Requirement**:

 Nothing in this section shall require a business to disclose trade secrets, as specified in regulations adopted pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.185. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall provide:

a) a process for a consumer to request that the business deletes any personal information about the consumer which the business has collected from the consumer;

b) specific criteria or conditions under which such deletion will occur.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 
The requirement is not satisfied because, although there is a "Request deletion of your personal data" link on the website, it does not clearly outline specific criteria or conditions for when deletion will occur. The phrase "under certain conditions" is vague and does not provide sufficient information about the criteria that need to be met for deletion to take place.

**Target Policy**: Request deletion of your personal data
under certain conditions.




**Requirement**:

 A business that collects personal information about consumers shall disclose, pursuant to Section 1798.130, the consumer's rights to request the deletion of the consumer's personal information. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 A business that receives a verifiable consumer request from a consumer to delete the consumer's personal information pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section shall delete the consumer's personal information from its records, notify any service providers or contractors to delete the consumer's personal information from their records, and notify all third parties to whom the business has sold or shared the personal information to delete the consumer's personal information unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall maintain:

a) a confidential record of deletion requests;
b) only for the purpose of preventing the personal information of a consumer who has submitted a deletion request from being sold, for compliance with laws or other purposes;

**Status**:
**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 
* The requirement states that the business may maintain a confidential record of deletion requests "solely" for specified purposes. However, it is not entirely clear if this limitation only applies to the specific purposes mentioned (preventing personal data from being sold, compliance with laws, or other permissible purposes). 

There is no explicit statement indicating that the organization will only use these records for these exact purposes without any further use or sharing of the deleted personal information.

**Target Policy**: Request deletion of your personal data
under certain conditions.




**Requirement**:

The business shall cooperate with a service provider or contractor in responding to a verifiable consumer request, and at the direction of the business, shall delete, or enable the business to delete and shall notify any of its own service providers or contractors to delete personal information about the consumer collected, used, processed, or retained by the service provider or the contractor.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence does not explicitly state that the business will cooperate with a service provider or contractor in responding to a verifiable consumer request. Instead, it mentions sharing and disclosure of personal data under certain circumstances, but does not provide information on how this applies to requests for deletion.
* Although the text does mention notification requirements for service providers or contractors, it is unclear if this includes cooperation with consumer requests for deletion.
* The evidence primarily focuses on data processing agreements with third-party providers, which is not directly related to cooperation with consumer requests.

**Target Policy**: Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Data 
Your personal data may be shared under the following circumstances: 
●​ Service Providers: With third-party providers that assist in delivering our 
services (e.g., cloud hosting, payment processing) under strict data processing 
agreements.




**Requirement**:

 A business, or a service provider or contractor acting pursuant to its contract with the business, another service provider, or another contractor, shall not be required to comply with a consumer's request to delete the consumer's personal information if it is reasonably necessary for the business, service provider, or contractor to maintain the consumer's personal information in order to:
(1) Complete the transaction for which the personal information was collected, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, provide a good or service requested by the consumer, or reasonably anticipated by the consumer within the context of a business' ongoing business relationship with the consumer, or otherwise perform a contract between the business and the consumer.
(2) Help to ensure security and integrity to the extent the use of the consumer's personal information is reasonably necessary and proportionate for those purposes.
(3) Debug to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
(4) Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise that consumer's right of free speech, or exercise another right provided for by law.
(5) Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code.
(6) Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research that conforms or adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the business' deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the ability to complete such research, if the consumer has provided informed consent.
(7) To enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer based on the consumer's relationship with the business and compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.
(8) Comply with a legal obligation.

**Requirement**:

 A consumer shall have the right to request a business that maintains inaccurate personal information about the consumer to correct that inaccurate personal information, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
A business that collects personal information about consumers shall disclose, pursuant to Section 1798.130, the consumer's right to request correction of inaccurate personal information.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because while the text mentions "request correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data", it does not explicitly mention disclosure of the consumer's right to request correction of inaccurate personal information as per Section 1798.130.
* Disclosure and correction are related but distinct concepts; the text only addresses a part of the required action (correction), without addressing the need for prior disclosure of this right.

**Target Policy**: Request correction of inaccurate or
incomplete personal data.




**Requirement**:

A business that receives a verifiable consumer request to correct inaccurate personal information shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the inaccurate personal information as directed by the consumer, pursuant to Section 1798.130 and regulations adopted pursuant to paragraph (8) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.185.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 
The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence does not explicitly state that the business will "correct" the inaccurate personal information as directed by the consumer. The request allows for correction, but it's unclear if this means actively correcting the data or just using commercially reasonable efforts to implement the correction requested by the consumer.

**Target Policy**: Request correction of inaccurate or
incomplete personal data.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall provide consumers with the right to request that a business disclose specific categories of personal information it has collected about the consumer.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement states that consumers should be informed about the categories of personal information, sources, purpose of collection, third-party disclosure, and specific pieces of personal information. However, the provided evidence only mentions receiving personal data through third-party channels without specifying what categories or pieces of information are involved.
* While it is mentioned that "business associates who have obtained appropriate permissions to share such information with us" is a source of personal data, it does not explicitly state which categories of personal information are being shared.

**Target Policy**: We may 
also receive personal data through third-party channels, including our authorized 
payment processors, marketing partners, advertising networks, and business 
associates who have obtained appropriate permissions to share such information with 
us.

Disclose and deliver the required information to a consumer free of charge, correct inaccurate personal information, or delete a consumer's personal information, based on the consumer's request, within 45 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request from the consumer. The business shall promptly take steps to determine whether the request is a verifiable consumer request, but this shall not extend the business's duty to disclose and deliver the information, to correct inaccurate personal information, or to delete personal information within 45 days of receipt of the consumer's request. The time period to provide the required information, to correct inaccurate personal information, or to delete personal information may be extended once by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary, provided the consumer is provided notice of the extension within the first 45-day period. The disclosure of the required information shall be made in writing and delivered through the consumer's account with the business, if the consumer maintains an account with the business, or by mail or electronically at the consumer's option if the consumer does not maintain an account with the business, in a readily useable format that allows the consumer to transmit this information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. The business may require authentication of the consumer that is reasonable in light of the nature of the personal information requested, but shall not require the consumer to create an account with the business in order to make a verifiable consumer request provided that if the consumer, has an account with the business, the business may require the consumer to use that account to submit a verifiable consumer request.

The disclosure of the required information shall cover the 12-month period preceding the business' receipt of the verifiable consumer request provided that, upon the adoption of a regulation pursuant to paragraph (9) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.185, a consumer may request that the business disclose the required information beyond the 12-month period, and the business shall be required to provide that information unless doing so proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.

A business that receives a verifiable consumer request pursuant to Section 1798.110 or 1798.115 shall disclose any personal information it has collected about a consumer, directly or indirectly, including through or by a service provider or contractor, to the consumer. A service provider or contractor shall not be required to comply with a verifiable consumer request received directly from a consumer or a consumer's authorized agent, pursuant to Section 1798.110 or 1798.115, to the extent that the service provider or contractor has collected personal information about the consumer in its role as a service provider or contractor. A service provider or contractor shall provide assistance to a business with which it has a contractual relationship with respect to the business' response to a verifiable consumer request, including, but not limited to, by providing to the business the consumer's personal information in the service provider or contractor's possession, which the service provider or contractor obtained as a result of providing services to the business, and by correcting inaccurate information or by enabling the business to do the same. A service provider or contractor that collects personal information pursuant to a written contract with a business shall be required to assist the business through appropriate technical and organizational measures in complying with the requirements of subdivisions (d) to (f), inclusive, of Section 1798.100, taking into account the nature of the processing.

**Requirement**:
A business shall, in a form that is reasonably accessible to consumers, respond to an objector's request regarding personal information collected about the consumer.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the provided evidence does not indicate that the business has responded to the consumer's objection. Instead, it appears that the business received a complaint from the consumer regarding processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes.
* Although the text mentions an "objector" and a request to object to processing of personal data, there is no indication that the business has taken steps to address this request or provide the required information.

**Requirement**:
Establish and maintain data recovery practices sufficient to restore in-scope enterprise assets to a pre-incident and trusted state.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement specifies establishing and maintaining "data recovery practices", which implies a need for structured procedures for restoring in-scope enterprise assets. While the evidence mentions backup strategies, redundant storage solutions, and recovery point objectives, these measures do not directly address the concept of data recovery practices.
* The provided text focuses on ensuring data integrity and availability with minimal data loss, but it does not explicitly mention the establishment and maintenance of data recovery practices as a specific requirement.
* Although the requirement is related to data protection, the evidence only partially addresses the requirements mentioned in the standard.

**Target Policy**: Data protection forms another crucial objective, as we 
commit to preserving data integrity and ensuring availability with minimal data loss 
through robust backup strategies, redundant storage solutions, and clearly defined 
recovery point objectives that balance business needs with technical capabilities.




**Requirement**:
Establish and maintain a data recovery process. In the process, address the scope of data recovery activities, recovery prioritization, and the security of backup data. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because, although the evidence mentions "robust backup strategies" and "redundant storage solutions", it does not explicitly state how these measures address the scope of data recovery activities, recovery prioritization, and the security of backup data.
* The statement focuses on preserving data integrity and ensuring availability with minimal data loss, but lacks specific details about implementing a comprehensive data recovery process that meets the requirements outlined in the original requirement.

**Target Policy**: Data protection forms another crucial objective, as we 
commit to preserving data integrity and ensuring availability with minimal data loss 
through robust backup strategies, redundant storage solutions, and clearly defined 
recovery point objectives that balance business needs with technical capabilities.




**Requirement**:

 Perform automated backups of in-scope enterprise assets. Run backups weekly, or more frequently, based on the sensitivity of the data. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall protect recovery data with equivalent controls to the original data. Reference encryption or data separation, based on requirements.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because while the text mentions robust backup strategies and redundant storage solutions, which could be considered as equivalent controls for recovery data, it does not explicitly mention using encryption or data separation.
* Although the organization's objective of preserving data integrity and ensuring availability suggests that they are taking steps to protect recovery data, the specific requirement of using equivalent controls is not met.

**Target Policy**: Data protection forms another crucial objective, as we 
commit to preserving data integrity and ensuring availability with minimal data loss 
through robust backup strategies, redundant storage solutions, and clearly defined 
recovery point objectives that balance business needs with technical capabilities.




**Requirement**:

Establish and maintain an isolated instance of recovery data. Example implementations include version controlling backup destinations through offline, cloud, or off-site systems or services.

**Status**:
Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only mentions "regularly back up cloud-based data" which does not explicitly address establishing and maintaining an isolated instance of recovery data. 
* Although the organization has taken steps to back up data, it is unclear if these backups are stored in a secure manner that meets the requirements for isolation.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Data Backup and Recovery: Regularly back up cloud-based data and establish 
tested recovery procedures to ensure data restoration in the event of a disaster or 
data loss.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall test backup recovery quarterly, or more frequently, for a sampling of in-scope enterprise assets.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
Although the text mentions "regular backups" and testing "recovery procedures", it does not explicitly state that this testing is done on a quarterly basis, nor does it specify that it applies to a sampling of in-scope enterprise assets. The evidence only mentions testing for critical data, which may not cover all in-scope assets.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Backup and Recovery: Regular backups of critical data will be performed, and 
recovery procedures will be periodically tested to ensure rapid restoration of 
operations.




**Requirement**:
Establish, implement, and actively manage (track, report, correct) network devices, in order to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable network services and access points.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions that Network Administrators will "Implement security controls" which does not explicitly include managing or tracking network devices. This suggests a lack of detail on how network devices are being actively managed.
* There is no mention of reporting or correcting vulnerabilities in the provided evidence, which are key components of the requirement.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Network Administrators: Implement security controls, maintain network 
infrastructure, and manage access.




**Requirement**:

 Ensure network infrastructure is kept up-to-date. Example implementations include running the latest stable release of software and/or using currently supported network-as-a-service (NaaS) offerings. Review software versions monthly, or more frequently, to verify software support. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall establish and maintain a secure network architecture that addresses segmentation, least privilege, and availability at a minimum.

**Status**:
**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because while the evidence mentions that the network is segmented to limit access between systems based on role and function, there is no explicit mention of addressing "least privilege" in the provided information.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Segmentation: The network is segmented to limit access between systems 
based on role and function, thereby reducing the potential impact of any security 
breach.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall securely manage network infrastructure.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions that "Network Administrators" are responsible for implementing security controls, maintaining network infrastructure, and managing access. There is no mention of secure management practices such as version-controlled-infrastructure-as-code or the use of secure network protocols like SSH and HTTPS.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Network Administrators: Implement security controls, maintain network 
infrastructure, and manage access.

 Require users to authenticate to enterprise-managed VPN and authentication services prior to accessing enterprise resources on end-user devices. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall establish and maintain dedicated computing resources, either physically or logically separated, for all administrative tasks or tasks requiring administrative access. The computing resources should be segmented from the enterprise's primary network and not be allowed internet access.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* Although the text mentions that Network Administrators will implement security controls, maintain network infrastructure, and manage access, it does not explicitly state that dedicated computing resources are established and maintained separately for administrative tasks.
* The fact that Network Administrators have specific roles and responsibilities suggests some level of separation, but it is unclear if this meets the requirement's criteria.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Network Administrators: Implement security controls, maintain network 
infrastructure, and manage access.




**Requirement**:

Operate processes and tooling to establish and maintain comprehensive network monitoring and defense against security threats across the enterprise's network infrastructure and user base.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because while the evidence mentions "network segmentation, deployment of firewalls and intrusion detection systems", it does not provide explicit information on the processes and tooling required to maintain comprehensive network monitoring. The absence of specific details on how these controls are used to establish and maintain comprehensive network monitoring and defense suggests that the organization may not be fully addressing this requirement.

**Target Policy**: These controls include network 
segmentation, deployment of firewalls and intrusion detection systems, and regular 
security audits.




**Requirement**:

Centralize security event alerting across enterprise assets for log correlation and analysis. Best practice implementation requires the use of a SIEM, which includes vendor-defined event correlation alerts. A log analytics platform configured with security-relevant correlation alerts also satisfies this Safeguard.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions "Real-Time Monitoring" as part of the Continuous Monitoring process under section 4.1, which includes monitoring for anomalies and potential security threats using automated tools augmented by analyst review. There is no explicit mention of centralizing security event alerting across enterprise assets or implementing a SIEM with vendor-defined event correlation alerts.

**Target Policy**: Monitoring and Alerting 
4.1 Continuous Monitoring 
The security operations function must implement: 
●​ Real-Time Monitoring: Security logs must be continuously monitored for 
anomalies and potential security threats using automated tools augmented by 
analyst review.




**Requirement**:

 Perform application layer filtering. Example implementations include a filtering proxy, application layer firewall, or gateway. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall tune security event alerting thresholds monthly, or more frequently.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
Although the evidence mentions that an "Alerting System" is in place, which implies some level of monitoring and notification, it does not explicitly state that the thresholds are being reviewed or adjusted on a regular basis. The requirement specifically states that the organization should tune security event alerting thresholds monthly or more frequently, but there is no direct evidence to support this claim.

**Target Policy**: Alerting System

Automated alerts are configured to notify
security personnel of potential security
incidents.




**Requirement**:

 Deploy a host-based intrusion detection solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate and/or supported. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

Deploy a network intrusion detection solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate. Example implementations include the use of a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) or equivalent cloud service provider (CSP) service.

**Status**:
Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions implementing IDPS in cloud environments and responding promptly to detected threats, but does not explicitly mention deploying an NIDS or equivalent CSP service on enterprise assets.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Implement intrusion detection and prevention 
systems (IDPS) to monitor cloud environments for malicious activity and respond 
promptly to detected threats.




**Requirement**:

 Perform traffic filtering between network segments, where appropriate. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall determine:

a) the conditions for remote access to enterprise resources;
b) the criteria used to assess and grant access to these resources.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only mentions Network Administrators' responsibilities, which includes implementing security controls and managing access, but it does not mention specific conditions or criteria for remote access.
* There is no indication that the organization has determined the conditions for remote access to enterprise resources, such as up-to-date anti-malware software installed, configuration compliance with the enterprise's secure configuration process, and ensuring the operating system and applications are up-to-date.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Network Administrators: Implement security controls, maintain network 
infrastructure, and manage access.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall collect network traffic flow logs and/or network traffic to review and alert upon from network devices.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement specifies that the organization should collect network traffic flow logs and/or network traffic, but the provided evidence only mentions "network monitoring and logging", which is a broader category that may not necessarily include collecting traffic flow logs.
* While it's possible to infer that network traffic collection is part of the monitoring and logging process, the specific requirement for collecting traffic flow logs and/or network traffic is not explicitly mentioned.

**Target Policy**: Network Monitoring and Logging 
 
6.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall deploy a host-based intrusion prevention solution on enterprise assets, where appropriate and/or supported.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions implementing "intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS)" in cloud environments, which does not explicitly mention deploying a host-based intrusion prevention solution on enterprise assets.
* While IDPS is related to intrusion prevention, the specific requirement for hosting-based solutions is not met in this case.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Implement intrusion detection and prevention 
systems (IDPS) to monitor cloud environments for malicious activity and respond 
promptly to detected threats.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall deploy a network intrusion prevention solution, where appropriate. Example implementations include the use of a Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) or equivalent CSP service.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the text only mentions implementing IDPS systems to monitor cloud environments for malicious activity and respond promptly to detected threats. This does not explicitly mention deploying a network intrusion prevention solution.
* There is no evidence that a NIPS or equivalent CSP service has been deployed, which is an example implementation of a network intrusion prevention solution as mentioned in the requirement.
* The focus on IDPS systems only addresses detection and response aspects, but does not cover the deployment of a proactive network intrusion prevention solution.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Implement intrusion detection and prevention 
systems (IDPS) to monitor cloud environments for malicious activity and respond 
promptly to detected threats.




**Requirement**:

 Deploy port-level access control. Port-level access control utilizes 802.1x, or similar network access control protocols, such as certificates, and may incorporate user and/or device authentication. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall establish and maintain a security awareness program to influence behavior among the workforce to be security conscious and properly skilled to reduce cybersecurity risks to the enterprise.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because the text does not provide information on whether a specific program has been established or maintained, nor does it specify any concrete steps for influencing behavior or skill level among employees. 
* There are no details about how the organization plans to measure the effectiveness of the security awareness program.
* Although there may be a Security Awareness and Training policy in place (as referenced by evidence 6), this is not explicitly linked to the requirement of establishing and maintaining a security awareness program.

**Target Policy**: Security Awareness and Training 
 
6.




**Requirement**:
Establish and maintain a security awareness program. The purpose of a security awareness program is to educate the enterprise's workforce on how to interact with enterprise assets and data in a secure manner. Conduct training at hire and, at a minimum, annually. Review and update content annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 
* The requirement specifies that the program should include annual training for all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors. However, the provided evidence only mentions "regular information security training" without explicitly stating that this is an annual requirement.
* Although the evidence does indicate that employee awareness training is conducted, it does not confirm whether this meets the specific requirements of establishing and maintaining a security awareness program, including review and update content annually or upon significant enterprise changes.

**Target Policy**: Training and Awareness 
●​ Employee Awareness: All employees, contractors, and third-party vendors will 
receive regular information security training to understand their roles and 
responsibilities in protecting information.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall train workforce members to recognize social engineering attacks, such as phishing, pre-texting, and tailgating.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions that engaging in or falling victim to phishing or social engineering tactics is strictly prohibited, but does not provide any information about training workforce members on how to recognize these attacks.
* While prohibition may be a good starting point, it is not enough to ensure that workforce members are adequately trained to prevent these types of attacks.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Phishing and Social Engineering: Engaging in or falling victim to phishing or social 
engineering tactics is strictly prohibited.




**Requirement**:

 Train workforce members on authentication best practices. Example topics include MFA, password composition, and credential management. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall train workforce members on how to identify and properly store, transfer, archive, and destroy sensitive data. This also includes training workforce members on clear screen and desk best practices, such as locking their screen when they step away from their enterprise asset, erasing physical and virtual whiteboards at the end of meetings, and storing data and assets securely.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 
The requirement is not satisfied because although there is a training program for employees and contractors with access to encrypted data or encryption keys, it does not explicitly cover all the aspects mentioned in the requirement, such as clear screen and desk best practices. The evidence only mentions training on "encryption standards, key management practices, and secure data handling", but not on other important practices like locking screens, erasing whiteboards, and storing data securely.

**Target Policy**: Training and Awareness 
●​ All employees and contractors with access to encrypted data or encryption keys 
must undergo regular training on encryption standards, key management 
practices, and secure data handling.




**Requirement**:

 Train workforce members to be aware of causes for unintentional data exposure. Example topics include mis-delivery of sensitive data, losing a portable end-user device, or publishing data to unintended audiences. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall ensure that workforce members are trained to:

a) recognize a potential incident;
b) report such an incident.

**Status**: **Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is satisfied because the evidence states that "Regular training will be conducted for employees, contractors, and partners to recognize potential incidents and respond appropriately." This suggests that the organization has taken concrete steps to train its workforce members on incident recognition and reporting.
* Although the text does not explicitly mention reporting incidents to a specific person or entity, it implies that training is being provided to equip workforce members with the necessary skills to take action in case of an incident.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Training and Awareness: Regular training will be conducted for employees, 
contractors, and partners to recognize potential incidents and respond 
appropriately.




**Requirement**:

 Train workforce to understand how to verify and report out-of-date software patches or any failures in automated processes and tools. Part of this training should include notifying IT personnel of any failures in automated processes and tools. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall train workforce members on the dangers of connecting to, and transmitting data over, insecure networks for enterprise activities. If the enterprise has remote workers, training must include guidance to ensure that all users securely configure their home network infrastructure.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement specifies training on the dangers of insecure networks, which is partially addressed by the Endpoint Security policy.
* However, the Endpoint Security policy only requires compliance with endpoint security policies, including updated antivirus software and encrypted connections. It does not specifically require guidance on securing home network infrastructure for remote workers.
* Therefore, while some aspects of the requirement are met, the lack of explicit guidance on home network configuration indicates that the requirement is not fully satisfied.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Endpoint Security: Users accessing company resources remotely must comply with 
endpoint security policies, including updated antivirus software and encrypted 
connections.




**Requirement**:
Conduct role-specific security awareness and skills training. Example implementations include secure system administration courses for IT professionals, OWASP® Top 10 vulnerability awareness and prevention training for web application developers, and advanced social engineering awareness training for high-profile roles.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions "Access Control Training" which does not cover all of the mentioned examples (e.g., OWASP Top 10 vulnerability awareness and prevention training for web application developers, and advanced social engineering awareness training for high-profile roles).

**Target Policy**: Security Training and Awareness 
9.1 User Awareness and Training 
●​ Access Control Training: All employees receive regular training on access control 
principles, secure credential management, and the recognition of potential security 
threats.




**Requirement**:

 Develop a process to evaluate service providers who hold sensitive data, or are responsible for an enterprise's critical IT platforms or processes, to ensure these providers are protecting those platforms and data appropriately. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Establish and maintain an inventory of service providers. The inventory is to list all known service providers, include classification(s), and designate an enterprise contact for each service provider. Review and update the inventory annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

Establish and maintain a service provider management policy. Ensure the policy addresses the classification, inventory, assessment, monitoring, and decommissioning of service providers. Review and update the policy annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because although the policy states it will be reviewed and updated annually or in response to significant changes, there is no explicit mention of addressing specific criteria (classification, inventory, assessment, monitoring, and decommissioning) for service providers.
* The policy lacks clarity on whether these specific aspects are included in the review and update process.

**Target Policy**: Policy Review and Updates 
This policy will be reviewed and updated annually or in response to significant changes 
in the business environment, technology, or external regulations.




**Requirement**:

 Classify service providers. Classification consideration may include one or more characteristics, such as data sensitivity, data volume, availability requirements, applicable regulations, inherent risk, and mitigated risk. Update and review classifications annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
Ensure that all service provider contracts include security requirements, including minimum security program requirements, security incident and/or data breach notification and response, data encryption requirements, and data disposal commitments. These security requirements must be consistent with the enterprise's service provider management policy.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because while the contracts with third-party service providers do include provisions for encryption and data protection in alignment with the policy, there is no direct evidence that all required security requirements are included.
* The absence of specific mention of other security requirements (e.g., minimum security program requirements, security incident and/or data breach notification and response) suggests a lack of thoroughness in ensuring that contracts meet the necessary security standards.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Contracts with third-party service providers must include provisions for encryption 
and data protection in alignment with this policy.




**Requirement**:

 Assess service providers consistent with the enterprise's service provider management policy. Assessment scope may vary based on classification(s), and may include review of standardized assessment reports, such as Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2) and Payment Card Industry (PCI) Attestation of Compliance (AoC), customized questionnaires, or other appropriately rigorous processes. Reassess service providers annually, at a minimum, or with new and renewed contracts. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall monitor service providers consistent with the enterprise's service provider management policy. Monitoring may include periodic reassessment of service provider compliance, monitoring service provider release notes, and dark web monitoring.

**Status**: 
Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
Although the text mentions "Auditing and Monitoring be conducted to ensure compliance" which includes monitoring, it does not explicitly state that monitoring is done consistently with the enterprise's service provider management policy. The requirement of monitoring being consistent with this policy is mentioned in the original statement but not supported by the evidence provided.

**Target Policy**: Regular audits and continuous
monitoring of information systems will

Auditing and Monitoring be conducted to ensure compliance
with this policy and detect any security
gaps.




**Requirement**:

 Securely decommission service providers. Example considerations include user and service account deactivation, termination of data flows, and secure disposal of enterprise data within service provider systems. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Manage the security life cycle of in-house developed, hosted, or acquired software to prevent, detect, and remediate security weaknesses before they can impact the enterprise. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

Establish and maintain a secure application development process. In the process, address such items as: secure application design standards, secure coding practices, developer training, vulnerability management, security of third-party code, and application security testing procedures. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only states "Implementing secure development practices is essential to minimize vulnerabilities in software applications." There is no specific mention of the required elements listed in the requirement (e.g., secure application design standards, secure coding practices, etc.). While implementing secure development practices is a good step, it does not explicitly address all the necessary aspects of the process as outlined in the requirement.

**Target Policy**: Secure Development Practices 
 
Implementing secure development practices is essential to minimize vulnerabilities in 
software applications.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall apply secure design principles in application architectures, including:

* Enforcing least privilege
* Validating every user operation through mediation
* Minimizing the application infrastructure attack surface

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
Although the text mentions "Implement security-by-design principles", it does not explicitly state that this includes applying secure design principles in application architectures.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Implement security-by-design principles.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall leverage vetted modules or services for application security components, such as identity management, encryption, and auditing and logging, and utilize platform features in critical security functions to reduce developers' workload and minimize design or implementation errors.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: The evidence provided suggests that the organization is not fully leveraging vetted modules or services for application security components. Instead, it mentions an alternative control approach where full encryption of data in use is not feasible, and additional security controls such as access controls, monitoring, and logging must be implemented. This implies that the organization may rely on more manual or custom solutions rather than using vetted modules or services.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Alternative Controls: When full encryption of data in use is not feasible, 
additional security controls such as access controls, monitoring, and logging 
must be implemented.




**Requirement**:
Apply static and dynamic analysis tools within the application life cycle to verify that secure coding practices are being followed.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because while it is mentioned that "Perform security testing (e.g., static/dynamic analysis, penetration testing)" is performed, this is a broader activity that includes both static and dynamic analysis.
* There is no specific evidence provided to confirm that only static and dynamic analysis tools are being applied within the application life cycle.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Perform security testing (e.g., static/dynamic analysis, penetration testing).




**Requirement**:
Conduct application penetration testing. For critical applications, authenticated penetration testing is better suited to finding business logic vulnerabilities than code scanning and automated security testing. Penetration testing relies on the skill of the tester to manually manipulate an application as an authenticated and unauthenticated user.

**Status**:
Requirement: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because there is no evidence that the organization conducts application penetration testing for critical applications. Although security testing is mentioned, it does not specify penetration testing.
* There is no mention of using authenticated penetration testing for business logic vulnerabilities or any other specific requirements mentioned in the original requirement.
* The emphasis on manual manipulation by the tester also suggests a lack of automation and structured approach to penetration testing.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Perform security testing (e.g., static/dynamic analysis, penetration testing).




**Requirement**:

 Conduct threat modeling. Threat modeling is the process of identifying and addressing application security design flaws within a design, before code is created. It is conducted through specially trained individuals who evaluate the application design and gauge security risks for each entry point and access level. The goal is to map out the application, architecture, and infrastructure in a structured way to understand its weaknesses. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

Establish and maintain a process to accept and address reports of software vulnerabilities, including providing a means for external entities to report. The process is to include such items as: a vulnerability handling policy that identifies reporting process, responsible party for handling vulnerability reports, and a process for intake, assignment, remediation, and remediation testing. As part of the process, use a vulnerability tracking system that includes severity ratings, and metrics for measuring timing for identification, analysis, and remediation of vulnerabilities. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions processes for identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities in a timely and systematic manner, but does not explicitly mention how this process involves third-party application developers as external entities or provides a means for them to report vulnerabilities.
* While the requirement suggests that external entities should be able to report vulnerabilities, there is no evidence to confirm that these entities are included in the process or that their reports will be addressed.

**Target Policy**: It 
defines processes for identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities in a timely 
and systematic manner.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall perform root cause analysis on security vulnerabilities.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions a comprehensive root cause analysis conducted by the Incident Response Team, but it does not specifically state that this analysis will be performed for each individual security vulnerability.
* While the phrase "methodically examine affected systems and networks" suggests some form of analysis, it is unclear if this process is tailored to identify underlying issues in code that create vulnerabilities.

**Target Policy**: This phase begins with a comprehensive root cause analysis conducted 
by the Incident Response Team, who will methodically examine affected systems and 
networks to identify the fundamental vulnerabilities or weaknesses that permitted the 
security breach.




**Requirement**:

 Establish and manage an updated inventory of third-party components used in development, often referred to as a "bill of materials," as well as components slated for future use. This inventory is to include any risks that each third-party component could pose. Evaluate the list at least monthly to identify any changes or updates to these components, and validate that the component is still supported. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Use up-to-date and trusted third-party software components. When possible, choose established and proven frameworks and libraries that provide adequate security. Acquire these components from trusted sources or evaluate the software for vulnerabilities before use. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
Establish and maintain a severity rating system and process for application vulnerabilities that facilitates prioritizing the order in which discovered vulnerabilities are fixed. This process includes setting a minimum level of security acceptability for releasing code or applications. Severity ratings bring a systematic way of triaging vulnerabilities that improves risk management and helps ensure the most severe bugs are fixed first. Review and update the system and process annually.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions "Remediation and Mitigation" which includes patch management, but it does not explicitly mention a severity rating system or process for application vulnerabilities.
* While patch management based on severity and impact suggests some level of prioritization, it does not guarantee that a systematic approach to triaging vulnerabilities is in place, such as the use of severity ratings.
* There is no information provided about setting a minimum level of security acceptability for releasing code or applications, which is also part of the requirement.

**Target Policy**: Remediation and Mitigation 
●​ Patch Management: IT Operations applies patches based on the severity and impact 
of vulnerabilities.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall use standard, industry-recommended hardening configuration templates for application infrastructure components.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions implementing "hardening and configuration modifications as necessary", which does not guarantee that standard, industry-recommended templates are being used. This lack of specificity suggests that the organization may be using custom or non-standard configurations for some or all of its application infrastructure components.
* There is no direct evidence to support the use of industry-recommended hardening configuration templates in the provided text.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Configuration Changes: Implement hardening and configuration modifications as 
necessary.




**Requirement**:

 Maintain separate environments for production and non-production systems. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall ensure that all software development personnel receive training in writing secure code for their specific development environment and responsibilities, including general security principles and application security standard practices.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions implementing "secure development practices" as a necessity to minimize vulnerabilities in software applications. It does not explicitly state that training in writing secure code is being conducted.
* Although the text suggests that training is required, it does not confirm whether this specific requirement has been implemented.
* There is no mention of conducting annual training or promoting security within the development team and building a culture of security among developers.

**Target Policy**: Secure Development Practices 
 
Implementing secure development practices is essential to minimize vulnerabilities in 
software applications.




**Requirement**:
Establish a program to develop and maintain an incident response capability (e.g., policies, plans, procedures, defined roles, training, and communications) to prepare, detect, and quickly respond to an attack.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because while the evidence shows that an Incident Response Plan (IRP) will be developed, maintained, and regularly updated, there is no clear indication that other necessary components of an incident response capability are in place.
* A well-rounded incident response program should also include defined roles, training, and communications. The text only mentions procedures for identifying, classifying, containing, and mitigating security incidents, which is part of the overall plan but does not necessarily mean all required components are addressed.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Incident Response Plan (IRP): A comprehensive IRP will be developed, 
maintained, and regularly updated, detailing procedures for identifying, 
classifying, containing, and mitigating security incidents.




**Requirement**:

 Designate one key person, and at least one backup, who will manage the enterprise's incident handling process. Management personnel are responsible for the coordination and documentation of incident response and recovery efforts and can consist of employees internal to the enterprise, third-party vendors, or a hybrid approach. If using a third-party vendor, designate at least one person internal to the enterprise to oversee any third-party work. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
Establish and maintain contact information for parties that need to be informed of security incidents. Contacts may include internal staff, third-party vendors, law enforcement, cyber insurance providers, relevant government agencies, Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) partners, or other stakeholders. Verify contacts annually to ensure that information is up-to-date.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
Although the evidence provided (utilizing risk registers, security assessments, incident reports, and industry threat intelligence) indicates a proactive approach to managing security incidents, it does not directly support the requirement of maintaining contact information for parties to be informed of security incidents. The requirement specifically mentions verifying contacts annually, but there is no clear indication in the provided evidence that this step has been taken.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Utilize risk registers, security assessments, incident reports, and industry threat 
intelligence.




**Requirement**:

 Establish and maintain an enterprise process for the workforce to report security incidents. The process includes reporting timeframe, personnel to report to, mechanism for reporting, and the minimum information to be reported. Ensure the process is publicly available to all of the workforce. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
Establish and maintain an incident response process that addresses roles and responsibilities, compliance requirements, and a communication plan. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions "established incident response procedures must be followed to contain, investigate, and remediate threats", which does not explicitly mention addressing roles and responsibilities, compliance requirements, or a communication plan.
* Although the text mentions following established procedures, it does not provide information on how these procedures address the required aspects of an incident response process.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Established incident response procedures must be followed to contain, investigate, 
and remediate threats.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall assign key roles and responsibilities for incident response, including staff from legal, IT, information security, facilities, public relations, human resources, incident responders, and analysts, as applicable. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions "Established incident response procedures must be followed to contain, investigate, and remediate threats." This suggests that the organization has procedures in place for responding to incidents, but it does not indicate whether these roles and responsibilities have been assigned.
* There is no mention of identifying key roles and responsibilities for incident response or reviewing them annually or upon significant enterprise changes.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Established incident response procedures must be followed to contain, investigate, 
and remediate threats.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall determine:

a) which primary and secondary mechanisms will be used to communicate and report during a security incident;
b) review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only mentions the IT Security Team conducting an investigation and implementing corrective actions as needed. While this indicates some level of activity during a security incident, it does not explicitly state which mechanisms will be used for communication and reporting.
* The requirement also includes a review process, but there is no clear indication that this review has been performed or will be done in the future.

**Target Policy**: 3.​ Investigation: The IT Security Team will conduct an investigation and implement 
corrective actions as needed.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall conduct:

a) plan and conduct routine incident response exercises and scenarios for key personnel involved in the incident response process to prepare for responding to real-world incidents;

b) Exercises need to test communication channels, decision-making, and workflows;
c) Conduct testing on an annual basis, at a minimum.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because while the organization mentions conducting "incident response drills" as part of their review process, it does not explicitly state that these drills test communication channels, decision-making, and workflows specifically.
* Although the text mentions testing on an annual basis, which meets one part of the requirement (b), the lack of detail on the specific exercises' focus and effectiveness assessment raises concerns about whether the requirement is fully met.

**Target Policy**: 9. Review and Testing 
●​ Incident Response Drills: Regular drills will be conducted to test the 
effectiveness of the incident response process and ensure that all team members 
are prepared.




**Requirement**:
Conduct post-incident reviews. Post-incident reviews help prevent incident recurrence through identifying lessons learned and follow-up action.

**Status**: 
**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided does not explicitly state that the organization conducts post-incident reviews to capture lessons learned and improve risk controls.
* While the requirement states that post-incident reviews help prevent incident recurrence, the provided evidence only mentions capturing lessons learned and improving risk controls, which are part of but not the entire scope of the required activity.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Conduct post-incident reviews to capture lessons learned and improve risk controls.




**Requirement**:
Establish and maintain security incident thresholds, including, at a minimum, differentiating between an incident and an event. Examples can include: abnormal activity, security vulnerability, security weakness, data breach, privacy incident, etc. Review annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 
The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence does not explicitly state how the organization differentiates between an incident and an event. The text only mentions establishing thresholds for security incidents without providing specific criteria for distinguishing between incidents and events, which are mentioned as examples in the requirement.

**Target Policy**: Our 
primary aim is to rapidly identify, contain, and mitigate the effects of security incidents to 
minimize operational disruption and potential damage to systems and data.




**Requirement**:

 Test the effectiveness and resiliency of enterprise assets through identifying and exploiting weaknesses in controls (people, processes, and technology), and simulating the objectives and actions of an attacker. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

Establish and maintain a penetration testing program appropriate to the size, complexity, and maturity of the enterprise. The penetration testing program shall include characteristics such as scope, frequency, limitations, point of contact information, remediation, and retrospective requirements.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions a single performance criterion for the penetration testing program: "Perform periodic penetration testing (at least annually)". There is no mention of other characteristics such as scope, limitations, point of contact information, remediation, or retrospective requirements that are also specified in the requirement.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Penetration Testing: Perform periodic penetration testing (at least annually).




**Requirement**:
The organization shall perform periodic external penetration tests based on program requirements, no less than annually. External penetration testing must include enterprise and environmental reconnaissance to detect exploitable information. Penetration testing requires specialized skills and experience and must be conducted through a qualified party. The testing may be clear box or opaque box.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 
* The evidence shows that the organization performs "periodic penetration testing" but does not specifically mention performing it at least annually.
* It is unclear if all penetration tests meet the requirements of including enterprise and environmental reconnaissance, require specialized skills and experience, and being conducted through a qualified party.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Penetration Testing: Perform periodic penetration testing (at least annually).




**Requirement**:

 Remediate penetration test findings based on the enterprise's policy for remediation scope and prioritization. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall validate security measures after each penetration test. If deemed necessary, modify rulesets and capabilities to detect the techniques used during testing.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement specifies that validation of security measures should occur "after" each penetration test, but it is unclear from the provided evidence if this step has been consistently performed as part of the manual security assessments and penetration testing process.
* While the organization mentions conducting manual security assessments and penetration testing, there is no explicit mention of validating security measures in these processes.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Manual security assessments and penetration testing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall perform periodic internal penetration tests based on program requirements, no less than annually. The testing may be clear box or opaque box.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 
The evidence states "Penetration Testing: Perform periodic penetration testing (at least annually)". This suggests that the requirement is being met as the organization has a plan to perform penetration tests at least annually, but it does not explicitly state that these tests are internal. Additionally, there is no mention of clear box or opaque box testing in the provided evidence, which seems to be an additional detail mentioned in the requirement.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Penetration Testing: Perform periodic penetration testing (at least annually).




**Requirement**:

 Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software (operating systems and applications) on the network so that only authorized software is installed and can execute, and that unauthorized and unmanaged software is found and prevented from installation or execution. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Establish and maintain a detailed inventory of all licensed software installed on enterprise assets. The software inventory must document the title, publisher, initial install/use date, and business purpose for each entry; where appropriate, include the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), app store(s), version(s), deployment mechanism, and decommission date. Review and update the software inventory bi-annually, or more frequently. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
Ensure that only currently supported software is designated as authorized in the software inventory for enterprise assets. If software is unsupported, yet necessary for the fulfillment of the enterprise's mission, document an exception detailing mitigating controls and residual risk acceptance. For any unsupported software without an exception documentation, designate as unauthorized. Review the software list to verify software support at least monthly, or more frequently.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because while there is a policy in place for ensuring proper licensing and compliance (License Compliance), it does not explicitly state that only currently supported software should be designated as authorized. The evidence provided focuses on license compliance, but the specific requirement regarding software support and authorization is not addressed.

**Target Policy**: ●​ License Compliance: Users must ensure that all software used on company 
systems is properly licensed and compliant with applicable agreements.




**Requirement**:

 Ensure that unauthorized software is either removed from use on enterprise assets or receives a documented exception. Review monthly, or more frequently. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Utilize software inventory tools, when possible, throughout the enterprise to automate the discovery and documentation of installed software. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Use technical controls, such as application allowlisting, to ensure that only authorized software can execute or be accessed. Reassess bi-annually, or more frequently. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Use technical controls to ensure that only authorized software libraries, such as specific .dll, .ocx, .so, etc., files are allowed to load into a system process. Block unauthorized libraries from loading into a system process. Reassess bi-annually, or more frequently. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Use technical controls, such as digital signatures and version control, to ensure that only authorized scripts, such as specific .ps1, .py, etc., files are allowed to execute. Block unauthorized scripts from executing. Reassess bi-annually, or more frequently. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall develop processes and technical controls to identify, classify, securely handle, retain, and dispose of data.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The evidence does not provide sufficient information to confirm that the organization has developed processes and technical controls for the specified activities. While it mentions "any operation performed on personal data", including collection, storage, retrieval, alteration, or deletion, it does not explicitly state that these operations are being handled according to specific processes and technical controls for identification, classification, secure handling, retention, and disposal of data.

**Target Policy**: Any operation performed on personal data, including collection,
storage, retrieval, alteration, or deletion.




**Requirement**:
Establish and maintain a data management process. In the process, address data sensitivity, data owner, handling of data, data retention limits, and disposal requirements, based on sensitivity and retention standards for the enterprise. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided does not explicitly state that a formal data management process has been established with clear policies and procedures for addressing all of the required aspects (data sensitivity, data owner, handling of data, data retention limits, and disposal requirements).
* Although the evidence mentions "maintenance of data availability and integrity" which is part of the requirement, it does not provide sufficient information about how this aspect is addressed in terms of data sensitivity, data owner, handling of data, etc.
* The mention of reviewing and updating documentation annually or when significant enterprise changes occur does not necessarily imply that a comprehensive data management process has been put in place.

**Target Policy**: These practices collectively ensure maintenance of data availability and 
integrity across the organization, protecting against accidental loss, corruption, or 
unauthorized modification of critical business information.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement encryption to protect sensitive data during transmission.

**Status**:
**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: Although the evidence mentions that industry-standard encryption protocols are employed, it does not explicitly state that TLS and OpenSSH (as mentioned in the example implementations) are specifically used for encrypting sensitive data in transit. The organization's use of "industry-standard encryption protocols" is too broad to confirm that the specific requirement is met.

**Target Policy**: We employ industry-standard encryption protocols for both data in transit 
and at rest, ensuring that information remains protected whether it's being transmitted 
across networks or stored in our databases and backup systems.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall implement encryption for sensitive data at rest on servers, applications, and databases containing sensitive data, with storage-layer encryption meeting the minimum requirement and additional encryption methods including application-layer encryption (client-side encryption) where applicable.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The evidence indicates that the organization uses encryption for sensitive data in transit and use within the cloud using strong encryption algorithms. However, it does not specifically mention encryption for sensitive data at rest on servers, applications, and databases containing sensitive data.
* While the requirement mentions storage-layer encryption as meeting the minimum requirement, it is unclear if all identified sensitive data will be encrypted using this method or if additional methods such as client-side encryption are also used.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Encryption: Encrypt data at rest, in transit, and in use within the cloud using strong 
encryption algorithms.




**Requirement**:

 Segment data processing and storage based on the sensitivity of the data. Do not process sensitive data on enterprise assets intended for lower sensitivity data. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Implement an automated tool, such as a host-based Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tool to identify all sensitive data stored, processed, or transmitted through enterprise assets, including those located onsite or at a remote service provider, and update the enterprise's sensitive data inventory. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall log sensitive data access, including modification and disposal.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 
* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions "require transaction logging and audit trails to maintain data integrity and track sensitive information access." This suggests that transaction logging and audit trails are required for data integrity and tracking access, but it does not explicitly state that this includes logging of sensitive data access, modification, and disposal.
* There is no direct mention of the specific requirement to log sensitive data access, including modification and disposal, which is a more comprehensive requirement than what is currently in place.

**Target Policy**: Require transaction logging and audit trails to maintain data
integrity and track sensitive information access.




**Requirement**:
Establish and maintain a data inventory, based on the enterprise's data management process. Inventory sensitive data, at a minimum. Review and update inventory annually, at a minimum, with a priority on sensitive data.

**Status**: Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is satisfied because the organization adheres strictly to data minimization principles, which implies that they are actively managing their data to reduce exposure and potential impact of security incidents.
* This adherence suggests that the organization has implemented measures to inventory sensitive data, as they only collect and process the minimum amount of personal and sensitive data necessary for legitimate business purposes.
* Although the text does not explicitly mention reviewing and updating the inventory annually, the emphasis on reducing exposure and potential impact of security incidents implies a regular review and update process, with a priority on sensitive data.

**Target Policy**: The organization adheres strictly to data minimization principles, collecting and 
processing only the minimum amount of personal and sensitive data necessary for 
legitimate business purposes, thus reducing exposure and potential impact of security 
incidents.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall configure data access control lists based on a user's need to know. Apply data access control lists, also known as access permissions, to local and remote file systems, databases, and applications.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 
* Although the text mentions that users are permitted to access only those systems and data for which they are authorized, it does not explicitly state that access control lists (ACLs) have been configured based on a user's need-to-know principle. The statement only confirms the permission system in place without detailing how ACLs are applied.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Access Control: Users are permitted to access only those systems and data for 
which they are authorized.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall retain data according to the enterprise's data management process. Data retention must include both minimum and maximum timelines.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the provided evidence only mentions a "retention period" that is based on when the personal data was collected, without mentioning any specific minimum or maximum timeline requirements.
* The text states that data retention may be longer if required or permitted by law, but does not specify how this would be implemented in terms of minimum and maximum timelines.

**Target Policy**: Data Retention 
Personal data is retained only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it 
was collected, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall ensure secure disposal of data as outlined in the enterprise's data management process, and that the disposal method is commensurate with the data sensitivity.

**Status**:
**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement mentions ensuring the disposal method is commensurate with the data sensitivity, but the provided evidence only states that all data is irretrievably erased after decommissioning equipment. There is no mention of considering the data sensitivity when selecting the disposal method.
 
However, the fact that "all data" is being securely disposed of and irretrievably erased does meet part of the requirement.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Secure Disposal: Decommissioned equipment is securely disposed of, with all 
data irretrievably erased.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement measures to encrypt data on end-user devices containing sensitive data.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions protecting sensitive and confidential data during transmission across networks and while stored on systems, servers, or backup media. It does not explicitly mention implementing encryption on end-user devices.
* While the examples of industry-standard encryption protocols (Windows BitLocker®, Apple FileVault®, Linux® dm-crypt) suggest that encryption measures are in place, it is unclear if these specific protocols will be implemented on end-user devices containing sensitive data.

**Target Policy**: All sensitive and 
confidential data will be protected using industry-standard encryption protocols both 
during transmission across networks and while stored on systems, servers, or backup 
media.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall establish and maintain an overall data classification scheme for the enterprise. Enterprises may use labels, such as "Sensitive," "Confidential," and "Public," and classify their data according to those labels. Review and update the classification scheme annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided does not support the existence of a comprehensive data classification scheme for the enterprise. While there is a specific policy (6.1 Data Classification and Handling) that addresses classifying data stored or processed in cloud environments, it does not explicitly cover all aspects of an overall data classification scheme for the entire enterprise.

The policy focuses solely on cloud-based data, whereas a comprehensive data classification scheme would require more extensive application across the entire organization, including on-premises systems, applications, and data storage. Therefore, the requirement is not met based on the provided evidence.

**Target Policy**: Data Security 
6.1 Data Classification and Handling 
●​ Data Classification: Classify all data stored or processed in cloud environments 
based on sensitivity and the potential impact of unauthorized disclosure, applying 
stricter controls to sensitive and confidential data.




**Requirement**:

 Document data flows. Data flow documentation includes service provider data flows and should be based on the enterprise's data management process. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement measures to protect data when it is transmitted over an insecure network or medium.

**Status**: 
Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions encrypting data "during transmission", which implies that this action may occur in some situations, but does not guarantee that all data transmissions are encrypted. Encrypting data on removable media specifically is not explicitly mentioned as a requirement or measure to be taken.

**Target Policy**: This includes using only company-approved 
cloud storage solutions and encrypting data during transmission, especially when 
accessing or transferring sensitive information.




**Requirement**:

 Establish and maintain the secure configuration of enterprise assets (end-user devices, including portable and mobile; network devices; non-computing/IoT devices; and servers) and software (operating systems and applications). 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Establish and maintain a secure configuration process for enterprise assets (end-user devices, including portable and mobile; non-computing/IoT devices; and servers) and software (operating systems and applications). Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Enforce automatic device lockout following a predetermined threshold of local failed authentication attempts on portable end-user devices, where supported. For laptops, do not allow more than 20 failed authentication attempts; for tablets and smartphones, no more than 10 failed authentication attempts. Example implementations include Microsoft® InTune Device Lock and Apple® Configuration Profile maxFailedAttempts. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Remotely wipe enterprise data from enterprise-owned portable end-user devices when deemed appropriate such as lost or stolen devices, or when an individual no longer supports the enterprise. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Ensure separate enterprise workspaces are used on mobile end-user devices, where supported. Example implementations include using an Apple® Configuration Profile or AndroidTM Work Profile to separate enterprise applications and data from personal applications and data. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Establish and maintain a secure configuration process for network devices. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall configure automatic session locking on enterprise assets after a defined period of inactivity, with the specified time limits as follows:

* For general purpose operating systems, the period must not exceed 15 minutes.
* For mobile end-user devices, the period must not exceed 2 minutes.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because there is no clear indication that automatic session locking has been configured on enterprise assets with the specified time limits. The provided evidence only mentions "Automatic session timeouts must be enforced to minimize security risks." which does not specify when these sessions will timeout or what devices are affected by this policy.

**Target Policy**: Session Timeouts

Security for inactive
sessions

Automatic session
timeouts must be enforced
to minimize security risks.




**Requirement**:
Implement and manage a firewall on servers, where supported. Example implementations include a virtual firewall, operating system firewall, or a third-party firewall agent.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions that "Firewalls are deployed at all network perimeters with strict access control rules." This suggests deployment of firewalls at network perimeters, but does not explicitly state their implementation on servers.
* There is no mention of virtual firewalls, operating system firewalls, or third-party firewall agents being used, which are examples of supported implementations.
* The evidence only provides information about the deployment and access control rules for firewalls at network perimeters, rather than their management on servers.

**Target Policy**: 4.3 Firewall and Intrusion Prevention 
●​ Firewalls are deployed at all network perimeters with strict access control rules.




**Requirement**:

 Implement and manage a host-based firewall or port-filtering tool on end-user devices, with a default-deny rule that drops all traffic except those services and ports that are explicitly allowed. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Securely manage enterprise assets and software. Example implementations include managing configuration through version-controlled-infrastructure-as-code and accessing administrative interfaces over secure network protocols, such as Secure Shell (SSH) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). Do not use insecure management protocols, such as Telnet (Teletype Network) and HTTP, unless operationally essential. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Manage default accounts on enterprise assets and software, such as root, administrator, and other pre-configured vendor accounts. Example implementations can include: disabling default accounts or making them unusable. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Uninstall or disable unnecessary services on enterprise assets and software, such as an unused file sharing service, web application module, or service function. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Configure trusted DNS servers on enterprise assets. Example implementations include: configuring assets to use enterprise-controlled DNS servers and/or reputable externally accessible DNS servers. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall use processes and tools to assign and manage authorization to credentials for user accounts, including administrator accounts, as well as service accounts, to enterprise assets and software.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions approved "enterprise password managers" for storing and managing corporate credentials, but does not mention any processes or tools for assigning and managing authorization to credentials.
* While using approved tools is a step in the right direction, it is not enough to fulfill the entire requirement. A process or tool that assigns and manages authorization is also necessary.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Approved Tools: Only approved enterprise password managers should be used to 
store and manage corporate credentials.




**Requirement**:

 Establish and maintain an inventory of all accounts managed in the enterprise. The inventory must include both user and administrator accounts. The inventory, at a minimum, should contain the person's name, username, start/ stop dates, and department. Validate that all active accounts are authorized, on a recurring schedule at a minimum quarterly, or more frequently. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement:

a) unique passwords for all enterprise assets;
b) best practice implementation of password management, including minimum password length requirements;

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions the use of approved enterprise password managers to store and manage corporate credentials. There is no information on implementing unique passwords for all enterprise assets or specifying a minimum password length requirement.

While the use of approved tools is a good practice, it does not directly address the requirement for unique passwords and minimum password length requirements.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Approved Tools: Only approved enterprise password managers should be used to 
store and manage corporate credentials.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall delete or disable any dormant accounts after a period of 45 days of inactivity, where supported.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence states that inactivity accounts inactive for 90 days will be disabled, which is longer than the required 45 days. This suggests that the organization's policy does not meet the specified deadline.

**Target Policy**: Inactivity Accounts inactive for 90 days will be

disabled.




**Requirement**:

 Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the user's primary, non-privileged account. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Establish and maintain an inventory of service accounts. The inventory, at a minimum, must contain department owner, review date, and purpose. Perform service account reviews to validate that all active accounts are authorized, on a recurring schedule at a minimum quarterly, or more frequently. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Centralize account management through a directory or identity service. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Use processes and tools to create, assign, manage, and revoke access credentials and privileges for user, administrator, and service accounts for enterprise assets and software. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Establish and follow a process, preferably automated, for granting access to enterprise assets upon new hire, rights grant, or role change of a user. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Establish and follow a process, preferably automated, for revoking access to enterprise assets, through disabling accounts immediately upon termination, rights revocation, or role change of a user. Disabling accounts, instead of deleting accounts, may be necessary to preserve audit trails. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall require all externally-exposed enterprise or third-party applications to enforce MFA, where supported. Enforcing MFA through a directory service or SSO provider is a satisfactory implementation of this Safeguard.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions that MFA is required for accessing critical network resources, but it does not provide information on whether externally-exposed enterprise or third-party applications are also subject to MFA enforcement.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required to access critical network resources.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall require:

* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users accessing the network remotely.

**Status**:
**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because while the evidence states that MFA is required for "all remote access and for privileged accounts", it does not explicitly state that MFA is required for all users accessing the network remotely.

**Target Policy**: ●​ MFA is required for all remote access and for privileged accounts.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all administrative access accounts, where supported, on all enterprise assets, whether managed on-site or through a third-party provider.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions that MFA is required for remote access and privileged accounts, but does not explicitly state that it is also required for administrative access accounts on all enterprise assets, regardless of whether they are managed on-site or through a third-party provider.

**Target Policy**: ●​ MFA is required for all remote access and for privileged accounts.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall establish and maintain an inventory of the enterprise's authentication and authorization systems, including those hosted on-site or at a remote service provider. Review and update the inventory, at a minimum, annually, or more frequently.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because there is no direct evidence provided that the organization has established an inventory of authentication and authorization systems.
* The text mentions business continuity and operational efficiency, but this does not directly address the inventory management of authentication and authorization systems.

**Target Policy**: Simultaneously, we strive to guarantee that information systems and data 
remain available to authorized users when needed, ensuring business continuity and 
operational efficiency.




**Requirement**:

 Centralize access control for all enterprise assets through a directory service or SSO provider, where supported. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall define and maintain role-based access control, through determining and documenting the access rights necessary for each role within the enterprise to successfully carry out its assigned duties. Perform access control reviews of enterprise assets to validate that all privileges are authorized, on a recurring schedule at a minimum annually, or more frequently.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because while the evidence indicates that users are assigned to roles with predefined access rights, there is no explicit information about performing regular access control reviews of enterprise assets. The presence of role-based access does not guarantee that all privileges are validated and authorized on a recurring schedule, which is a critical aspect of maintaining effective role-based access control.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Role-Based Access: Users are assigned to roles with predefined access rights, 
ensuring that they only access resources pertinent to their responsibilities.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall develop a plan to continuously assess and track vulnerabilities on all enterprise assets within the enterprise's infrastructure, in order to remediate, and minimize, the window of opportunity for attackers. Monitor public and private industry sources for new threat and vulnerability information.

**Status**:
Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The requirement mentions developing a specific plan for continuous vulnerability assessment and tracking, but the provided evidence only mentions "Monitor for vulnerabilities and security incidents", which is a partial step towards addressing the requirement.
* The organization needs to demonstrate a comprehensive approach to addressing vulnerabilities, including remediation and minimizing attack windows, in addition to just monitoring.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Monitor for vulnerabilities and security incidents.




**Requirement**:

 Establish and maintain a documented vulnerability management process for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall establish and maintain a risk-based remediation strategy documented in a remediation process, with monthly, or more frequent, reviews.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions "continuously monitor risks and track remediation efforts", which does not explicitly mention establishing and maintaining a risk-based remediation strategy. While this suggests that some level of risk monitoring is occurring, it does not confirm the existence of a documented remediation process with regular reviews.
* The lack of detail on the documentation and review frequency makes it unclear if the organization is meeting the specific requirements outlined in the requirement.

**Target Policy**: 4.4 Risk Monitoring and Reporting 
●​ Continuously monitor risks and track remediation efforts.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall perform operating system updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions that all network devices must be patched regularly, but it does not explicitly state that operating system updates are performed on a monthly, or more frequent, basis.
* Although automated patch management is mentioned, there is no clear indication that this process includes operating system updates for enterprise assets.

**Target Policy**: Patch Management and System Updates 
●​ All network devices, including routers, switches, and firewalls, must be patched 
regularly.




**Requirement**:

 Perform application updates on enterprise assets through automated patch management on a monthly, or more frequent, basis. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Perform automated vulnerability scans of internal enterprise assets on a quarterly, or more frequent, basis. Conduct both authenticated and unauthenticated scans, using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Perform automated vulnerability scans of externally-exposed enterprise assets using a SCAP-compliant vulnerability scanning tool. Perform scans on a monthly, or more frequent, basis. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
Remediate detected vulnerabilities in software through processes and tooling on a monthly, or more frequent, basis, based on the remediation process.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only defines processes for identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities but does not specifically mention the frequency of remediation (monthly or more frequently) as part of those processes.

**Target Policy**: It 
defines processes for identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities in a timely 
and systematic manner.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall collect, alert, review, and retain audit logs of events that could help detect, understand, or recover from an attack.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* Although the evidence mentions "access logs" being maintained to track activities and detect potential security incidents, it does not explicitly mention collecting, reviewing, or retaining audit logs specifically for detecting, understanding, or recovering from an attack.
* The requirement is more specific about the scope of audit log retention and review, which is not fully addressed by the provided evidence.

**Target Policy**: Access logs will be maintained to track activities and detect potential 
security incidents.




**Requirement**:
Establish and maintain an audit log management process that defines the enterprise's logging requirements. At a minimum, address the collection, review, and retention of audit logs for enterprise assets. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.

**Status**:
**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only mentions "require transaction logging and audit trails to maintain data integrity and track sensitive information access." This suggests that the organization does have a logging requirement, but it does not explicitly state that the requirement includes the collection, review, and retention of audit logs for enterprise assets, which are explicitly mentioned in the requirement.

**Target Policy**: Require transaction logging and audit trails to maintain data
integrity and track sensitive information access.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall retain audit logs across all enterprise assets for a minimum of 90 days.

**Status**:
**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence states that audit logs are retained for a minimum of one year, which is longer than the required 90 days.
* This indicates that the organization has set an overly long retention period, potentially exceeding the necessary timeframe to meet the requirements.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Log Retention: Audit logs are retained for a minimum of one year for monitoring and 
investigation purposes.




**Requirement**:

Conduct reviews of audit logs to detect anomalies or abnormal events that could indicate a potential threat. Conduct reviews on a weekly, or more frequent, basis.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because while the organization mentions regular audits as part of its policy, there is no specific mention of conducting reviews of audit logs to detect anomalies on a frequency that matches the requirement (weekly or more frequently). The organization's audit process only mentions "both automated assessment tools and manual review processes" without specifying how often these reviews are conducted.

**Target Policy**: Policy Compliance and Enforcement 
To ensure ongoing adherence to this policy: 
Audits: Regular audits will be performed to verify compliance with this policy through 
both automated assessment tools and manual review processes.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall collect service provider logs, where supported. Example implementations include collecting authentication and authorization events, data creation and disposal events, and user management events.

**Status**:
**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 
* The requirement is 'Not Satisfied' because the evidence provided only mentions implementing access controls and logging mechanisms, but does not explicitly mention collecting service provider logs. While it's possible that this requirement may be indirectly addressed through the implementation of access controls and logging mechanisms, the text does not provide direct evidence to support this assumption.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Implement access controls and logging mechanisms.




**Requirement**:

 Collect audit logs. Ensure that logging, per the enterprise's audit log management process, has been enabled across enterprise assets. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
Ensure that logging destinations maintain adequate storage to comply with the enterprise's audit log management process.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement explicitly states that transaction logging and audit trails must maintain data integrity and track sensitive information access, but it does not mention anything about storing these logs in a way that ensures "adequate storage" as per the enterprise's audit log management process.
* While the evidence mentions requirements for transaction logging and audit trails, it does not specifically address the issue of adequate storage.

**Target Policy**: Require transaction logging and audit trails to maintain data
integrity and track sensitive information access.




**Requirement**:

 Standardize time synchronization. Configure at least two synchronized time sources across enterprise assets, where supported. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
Configure detailed audit logging for enterprise assets containing sensitive data. Include event source, date, username, timestamp, source addresses, destination addresses, and other useful elements that could assist in a forensic investigation.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence states "Require transaction logging and audit trails to maintain data integrity and track sensitive information access." This statement does not explicitly mention configuring detailed audit logging for enterprise assets, which includes specific elements such as event source, date, username, timestamp, source addresses, and destination addresses.
* While the requirement mentions useful elements that could assist in a forensic investigation, it does not specify what those elements should be or if they match the ones mentioned in the requirement.

**Target Policy**: Require transaction logging and audit trails to maintain data
integrity and track sensitive information access.




**Requirement**:

 Collect DNS query audit logs on enterprise assets, where appropriate and supported.

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any communication and any actions taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 shall be provided free of charge. Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may either:
(a) charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested; or
(b) refuse to act on the request.
The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

The controller shall provide the data subject with all of the following information at the time when personal data are obtained:

(a) the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller's representative;
(b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;
(c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing;
(d) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party;
(e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;
(f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions the legal grounds for processing personal data (consent) without explicitly providing the information required by points c), d), e), f) and does not mention the controller's contact details or representative's contact details. The information provided in the legal basis section, while relevant to the processing of personal data, is not sufficient to meet the specific requirements outlined in the regulation.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:
The controller shall provide the data subject with additional information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing, including:

(a) the period for which the personal data will be stored;
(b) the existence of certain rights related to the personal data;
(c) the right to withdraw consent in cases where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2);
(d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
(e) whether the provision of personal data is required by law, contract, or necessary to enter into a contract;
(f) the existence and significance of automated decision-making processes.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only shows some of the rights listed in the requirement (e.g. Right to Access, Right to Rectification, Right to Erasure, Right to Restriction of Processing, Right to Data Portability, and Right to Object) but does not demonstrate that all required information is being provided to data subjects upon obtaining their personal data. Specifically, it lacks information on the period of storage, whether provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, and the existence and significance of automated decision-making processes.

Description

Request access to your personal data
and receive a copy of the information
we hold.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall provide the data subject prior to further processing of their personal data with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only shows a request for the personal data to be transferred to another controller in a machine-readable format, which does not necessarily imply provision of additional information on the intended purpose of further processing.
* The request for machine-readable format may be part of the data subject's right to data portability under GDPR, but it does not explicitly address the requirement to provide information on the other purpose and any relevant further information.

**Target Policy**: Request your personal data in a
structured, commonly used,
machine-readable format for transfer to
another data controller.




**Requirement**:

 Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply where and insofar as the data subject already has the information. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

The controller shall provide the data subject with the following information:

(a) the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller's representative;
(b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable;
(c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing;
(d) the categories of personal data concerned;
(e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;
(f) where applicable, that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a recipient in a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions that the policy explains how personal data are collected, used, disclosed, and safeguarded in compliance with applicable data protection laws. There is no explicit mention of providing the specified information to the data subject as required by GDPR.
* Although the text does mention the controller's identity and contact details, it does not explicitly state that this information will be provided to the data subject where personal data have not been obtained from them.
* The requirement also specifies additional information that must be provided in certain circumstances (e.g., transfer of personal data to a third country), which is not present in the provided evidence.

**Target Policy**: This policy explains 
how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal data in compliance with 
applicable data protection laws.




**Requirement**:
The controller shall provide the data subject with information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the data subject, including:

a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;
b) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party;
c) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject and to object to processing as well as the right to data portability;
d) where processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal;
e) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
f) from which source the personal data originate, and if applicable, whether it came from publicly accessible sources;
g) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 
The requirement is not satisfied because the provided evidence only mentions a legal basis for processing personal data based on consent, without explicitly stating any of the required information to ensure fair and transparent processing. The text does not mention the criteria used to determine the period of storage or provide details about legitimate interests pursued by the controller. It also does not provide information about the existence of rights such as access, rectification, erasure, restriction, withdrawal of consent, complaint, data portability, automated decision-making, and profiling.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:

 The controller shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2:
(a) within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal data, but at the latest within one month, having regard to the specific circumstances in which the personal data are processed;
(b) if the personal data are to be used for communication with the data subject, at the latest at the time of the first communication to that data subject; or
(c) if a disclosure to another recipient is envisaged, at the latest when the personal data are first disclosed. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall provide the data subject prior to further processing of their personal data with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because, although the evidence shows a request for data subjects to retrieve their personal data in a machine-readable format, it does not explicitly demonstrate an organization's intention to provide data subjects with information on other purposes prior to further processing.
* The fact that the organization provides an easy way for data subjects to obtain their personal data does not necessarily imply compliance with this requirement.

**Target Policy**: Request your personal data in a
structured, commonly used,
machine-readable format for transfer to
another data controller.




**Requirement**:

Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply where and insofar as:

a) the data subject already has the information;
b) the provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort, in particular for processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 89(1) or in so far as the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing. In such cases the controller shall take appropriate measures to protect the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including making the information publicly available;
c) obtaining or disclosure is expressly laid down by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which provides appropriate measures to protect the data subject's legitimate interests; or
d) where the personal data must remain confidential subject to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by Union or Member State law, including a statutory obligation of secrecy.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

The requirement is not satisfied because it does not explicitly mention that the organization will provide alternative measures for individuals whose rights and freedoms may be impaired due to the limitation in paragraphs 1 to 4. While it mentions taking appropriate measures, it does not specify what these measures are or how they will be implemented. The absence of clear guidance on this point suggests a lack of compliance with this requirement.

**Target Policy**: Confidentiality of information represents a fundamental obligation, requiring 
users to diligently protect any sensitive or confidential data they access, process, or 
store during the course of their work activities.




**Requirement**:

The controller shall provide data subjects with confirmation as to whether or not their personal data are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and specified information.

a) The purpose of processing;
b) The categories of personal data concerned;
c) The recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed;
d) Where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored; or if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;
e) The existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing;
f) The right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
g) Where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;
h) The existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because the legal basis provided does not explicitly mention the right to access personal data or provide the specified information.
* Although the text mentions "processing" of personal data, it does not explicitly address the requirements set out in the original requirement.
* There is no indication that the controller has taken steps to provide data subjects with the required confirmation and access to their personal data.

Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:

The organization shall provide the data subject with the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 when personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because while the policy explains how personal data are collected, used, disclosed, and safeguarded, it does not explicitly mention providing the data subject with the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 when transfers occur.
* Although the policy mentions compliance with "applicable data protection laws", it does not specifically address the requirement related to Article 46.

**Target Policy**: This policy explains 
how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal data in compliance with 
applicable data protection laws.




**Requirement**:
The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence shows that the organization is willing to provide personal data upon request, but it does not explicitly state that they will provide it in a "commonly used electronic form" as required by law. While the request for structured, machine-readable format for transfer to another data controller is similar to the requirement, it does not necessarily imply compliance with the exact wording of the regulation.

**Target Policy**: Request your personal data in a
structured, commonly used,
machine-readable format for transfer to
another data controller.




**Requirement**:

 The right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph 3 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall provide data subjects with the right to rectification of inaccurate personal data without undue delay, taking into account the purposes of processing and the need for completion of incomplete personal data.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because the provided evidence only outlines the "Right to Rectification" in a general manner, stating that data subjects have the right to request rectification without specifying any additional conditions or processes. While it does mention the need for completion of incomplete personal data by providing a supplementary statement, this is presented as part of the description of the right rather than as a specific requirement to be met.

**Requirement**:
The controller shall provide the data subject with the right to erasure of personal data without undue delay where one of the grounds applies (Article 17(1) of the GDPR).

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because, although the organization provides a "Right to Erasure" section under the general description of "Your Rights as a Data Subject", it does not explicitly state that they will erase personal data without undue delay when requested by the data subject.
* There is no information provided in this document about how DANFECORP plans to handle requests for erasure, such as what procedures are in place or timelines for completion.

Description

Request access to your personal data
and receive a copy of the information
we hold.




**Requirement**:
The controller shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform processors of personal data that a data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 
The reason is not sufficient because it does not explicitly state that the controller shall "inform" the relevant controllers, which are likely processors. The use of the phrase "request deletion" suggests that the controller is taking action themselves but does not explicitly indicate that they will inform processors about the data subject's request for erasure.

**Target Policy**: Request deletion of your personal data
under certain conditions.




**Requirement**:

 Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary:
(a) for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
(b) for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
(c) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with points (h) and (i) of Article 9(2) as well as Article 9(3);
(d) for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing; or
(e) for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:

(a) the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
(b) the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use instead;
(c) the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
(d) the data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only mentions one right related to restriction of processing, which is "Right to Restriction of Processing". It does not mention any information about the other options specified in the regulation (a), b), or c) and d). The text only briefly describes what happens when a data subject requests to restrict processing under the Right to Restriction of Processing.

Description

Request access to your personal data
and receive a copy of the information
we hold.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall ensure that, where processing has been restricted under paragraph 1, such personal data shall only be processed with the data subject's consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The evidence provided shows that the organization has requested limitations on the processing of personal data, but it does not explicitly state that this request is subject to the requirements specified in paragraph 1.
* There is no indication that the organization is actively seeking consent from data subjects or using the limited processing for legal claims or protecting another person's rights.

**Target Policy**: Request limitations on the processing of
your personal data.




**Requirement**:

 A data subject who has obtained restriction of processing pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be informed by the controller before the restriction of processing is lifted. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The controller shall communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing carried out in accordance with Article 16, Article 17(1) and Article 18 to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The controller shall inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject requests it. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall ensure that individuals have the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format upon request.

**Status**:
**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* Although the evidence provided shows that an individual has been offered the opportunity to request their personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format for transfer to another data controller, this is not explicitly stated as a requirement within the organization's policies or procedures.
* The text only mentions providing the right to receive personal data in a specific format upon request, but it does not state that this right must be guaranteed by law or as an organizational policy.

**Target Policy**: Request your personal data in a
structured, commonly used,
machine-readable format for transfer to
another data controller.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall provide data subjects with the option to have their personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible, upon request for data portability.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: The requirement is not satisfied because although the evidence states that the organization will "request your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format for transfer to another data controller", this does not explicitly state that they will also facilitate the transmission of the data directly from one controller to another. The request only specifies how the data should be provided, but not necessarily how it should be transmitted.

**Target Policy**: Request your personal data in a
structured, commonly used,
machine-readable format for transfer to
another data controller.




**Requirement**:

 The exercise of the right referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be without prejudice to Article 17. That right shall not apply to processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The right referred to in paragraph 1 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall:

a) inform data subjects of their rights in relation to processing of their personal data;

b) provide a clear and transparent explanation of the legal basis for processing, including profiling.

c) ensure that the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for processing which override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because, although the organization mentions "applicable data protection laws" as a legal ground for processing, it does not explicitly inform data subjects of their rights in relation to processing of their personal data.
* Although the text provides a clear and transparent explanation of one legal ground (consent), it only addresses this specific scenario and does not cover all possible scenarios where data is processed based on points (e) or (f) of Article 6(1).
* Furthermore, there is no mention of how the controller will ensure that compelling legitimate grounds for processing override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:

The organization shall provide a clear and documented legal basis for processing personal data, including the right to object to direct marketing and profiling.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the provided evidence only mentions "Consent" as one of the legal grounds for processing personal data, without explicitly mentioning the right to object.
* Although consent includes opt-out mechanisms, such as the option to unsubscribe from marketing communications, it does not necessarily include the explicit right to object to direct marketing and profiling as required by the regulation.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:

The organization shall implement a mechanism where data subjects' objections to processing for direct marketing purposes are respected and their personal data is not further processed for such purposes.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions deleting or anonymizing personal data once it is no longer needed, which does not address the specific objection from a data subject. This suggests that the organization may continue to process personal data for direct marketing purposes even if a data subject objects.
* There is no indication in the evidence that the organization has an active mechanism in place to respect data subjects' objections or to ensure their personal data is not further processed for direct marketing purposes.

**Target Policy**: Once 
personal data is no longer needed, it will be securely deleted or anonymized.




**Requirement**:

 At the latest at the time of the first communication with the data subject, the right referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and shall be presented clearly and separately from any other information. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, the data subject may exercise his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1), the data subject, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, shall have the right to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because there is no evidence that the individual has been informed of their right to object to processing of their personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. The presence of an individual whose personal data is being processed does not necessarily imply that they have been notified of their rights, including the right to object.

**Target Policy**: The individual whose personal data is being processed.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall provide data subjects with the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only mentions "Consent" as one of the legal grounds for processing personal data, without explicitly mentioning the right against automated processing that produces legal effects.
* While the organization has implemented a system where data subjects can opt-out of marketing communications through consent, it does not appear to address the specific right to object to decisions based solely on automated processing.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:

The organization shall not have a situation where a decision is made under paragraph 1, except for one of the following conditions:

a) the decision is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller;
b) the decision is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or
c) the decision is based on the data subject's explicit consent.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

The requirement is not satisfied because, although the organization mentions that appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g., standard contractual clauses), there is no clear indication that such safeguards apply to every situation where a decision under paragraph 1 would normally be made. The text only highlights measures taken in "such cases", which implies that these exceptions might still result in decisions being made without explicit consent, authorisation by law, or necessity for contract performance.

**Target Policy**: In such cases, we ensure that appropriate 
safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent 
mechanisms, to protect your data.




**Requirement**:

 In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 2, the data controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be based on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1), unless point (a) or (g) of Article 9(2) applies and suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated where necessary. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where proportionate in relation to processing activities, the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the implementation of appropriate data protection policies by the controller. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Adherence to approved codes of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the rights of data subjects, taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* Although the text mentions implementing measures to protect data subjects' rights, it does not provide sufficient evidence that these measures are proportionate and effective in light of the risks identified.
* The Legal Basis for Processing section lists specific legal grounds (e.g., Consent), but it does not explicitly address how these measures are designed to implement data-protection principles such as data minimisation.
* Furthermore, there is no mention of conducting a risk assessment or identifying potential risks and their corresponding mitigations, which is an essential aspect of implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:

 The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing, they shall be joint controllers. They shall in a transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the obligations under this Regulation, in particular as regards the exercising of the rights of the data subject and their respective duties to provide the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14, by means of an arrangement between them unless, and in so far as, the respective responsibilities of the controllers are determined by Union or Member State law to which the controllers are subject. The arrangement may designate a contact point for data subjects. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The arrangement referred to in paragraph 1 shall duly reflect the respective roles and relationships of the joint controllers vis-à-vis the data subjects. The essence of the arrangement shall be made available to the data subject. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Irrespective of the terms of the arrangement referred to in paragraph 1, the data subject may exercise his or her rights under this Regulation in respect of and against each of the controllers. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where Article 3(2) applies, the controller or the processor shall designate in writing a representative in the Union. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The obligation laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to:
(a) processing which is occasional, does not include, on a large scale, processing of special categories of data as referred to in Article 9(1) or processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10, and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, taking into account the nature, context, scope and purposes of the processing; or
(b) a public authority or body. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The representative shall be established in one of the Member States where the data subjects, whose personal data are processed in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The representative shall be mandated by the controller or processor to be addressed in addition to or instead of the controller or the processor by, in particular, supervisory authorities and data subjects, on all issues related to processing, for the purposes of ensuring compliance with this Regulation. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The designation of a representative by the controller or processor shall be without prejudice to legal actions which could be initiated against the controller or the processor themselves. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Without prejudice to Articles 82, 83 and 84, if a processor infringes this Regulation by determining the purposes and means of processing, the processor shall be considered to be a controller in respect of that processing. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The processor shall not engage another processor without prior specific or general written authorisation of the controller. In the case of general written authorisation, the processor shall inform the controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to object to such changes. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because the organization does not have a contract or legal act that governs processing by a processor. Instead, they mention "applicable data protection laws" as the legal ground for processing personal data.
* While consent is mentioned as one of the legal grounds, it does not meet the requirements outlined in Article 28(3)(e) of the Regulation, which requires processors to be subject to a contract or other binding legal act that sets out the obligations and rights of both parties.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:

 Where a processor engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor as referred to in paragraph 3 shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation. Where that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, the initial processor shall remain fully liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor's obligations. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Adherence of a processor to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate sufficient guarantees as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 of this Article. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Without prejudice to an individual contract between the controller and the processor, the contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may be based, in whole or in part, on standard contractual clauses referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Article, including when they are part of a certification granted to the controller or processor pursuant to Articles 42 and 43. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The Commission may lay down standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2). 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 A supervisory authority may adopt standard contractual clauses for the matters referred to in paragraph 3 and 4 of this Article and in accordance with the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The contract or the other legal act referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be in writing, including in electronic form. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The processor and any person acting under the authority of the controller or of the processor, who has access to personal data, shall not process those data except on instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

Each controller and, where applicable, the controller's representative, shall maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. That record shall contain all of the following information:
(a) the name and contact details of the controller and, where applicable, the joint controller, the controller's representative and the data protection officer;
(b) the purposes of the processing;
(c) a description of the categories of data subjects and of the categories of personal data;
(d) the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed including recipients in third countries or international organisations;
(e) where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including the identification of that third country or international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;
(f) where possible, the envisaged time limits for erasure of the different categories of data;
(g) where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1).

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions that the organization has a policy explaining how they collect, use, disclose, and safeguard personal data. There is no explicit mention of maintaining a record of processing activities under their responsibility.
* The required information (a-g) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided evidence.
* While the text does provide general information about data protection, it does not meet the specific requirements outlined in the regulation.

**Target Policy**: This policy explains 
how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal data in compliance with 
applicable data protection laws.




**Requirement**:

 Each processor and where applicable, the processor's representative shall maintain a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a controller, containing:
(a) the name and contact details of the processor or processors and of each controller on behalf of which the processor is acting, and, where applicable, of the controller's or the processor's representative, and the data protection officer;
(b) the categories of processing carried out on behalf of each controller;
(c) where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including the identification of that third country or international organisation and, in the case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards;
(d) where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational security measures referred to in Article 32(1).

**Requirement**:

 The records referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be in writing, including in electronic form. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The controller or the processor and, where applicable, the controller's or the processor's representative, shall make record available to the supervisory authority on request. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall not be subject to the obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 if it employs fewer than 250 persons and the processing it carries out does not meet certain conditions.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is Not Satisfied because the evidence shows that the organization will still be subject to these obligations even if it has fewer than 250 employees, as long as the processing meets certain conditions. This implies that there are exceptions to the rule.
* The presence of specific conditions (processing likely to result in a risk to data subjects, not occasional, or special categories of data) suggests that the organization needs to take extra precautions when employing fewer staff members.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Legal Obligation: When processing is required to comply with legal obligations 
(e.g., financial or tax requirements).




**Requirement**:

 The controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representatives, shall cooperate, on request, with the supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate:

a) the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data;
b) the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
c) the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;
d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because while there is evidence that the organization has implemented some security measures, such as encryption in shared or multi-tenant environments (4.3 Data in Use), it is unclear if these measures meet the requirements specified in the regulation.
* There is no direct evidence to suggest that the pseudonymisation and encryption of personal data (a) is being implemented, although this requirement is mentioned as part of the overall security measures.
* The ability to restore availability and access to personal data in a timely manner (c) is also not explicitly stated as being implemented.
* The process for regularly testing and evaluating technical and organisational measures (d) is also not clearly outlined.

**Target Policy**: 4.2 Data in Transit 
 
4.3 Data in Use 
●​ Processing Protection: Where feasible, encryption should be applied to data 
during processingâ€”especially in shared or multi-tenant environments where the 
risk of unauthorized access is elevated.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall take into account, in particular, the risks that are presented by processing personal data, including accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to such data.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because while the text mentions covering risks related to financial, operational, security, compliance, and reputation, it does not specifically mention personal data. The phrase "personal data" is not present in the evidence, which suggests that the organization's risk assessment may not be focused on this specific type of data.
* Although the requirement explicitly mentions processing, the focus on "processing personal data" is not met, as the text only discusses "processing" without specifying the type of data.

**Target Policy**: It 
covers risks related to financial, operational, security, compliance, and reputation.




**Requirement**:

 Adherence to an approved code of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or an approved certification mechanism as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraph 1 of this Article. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The controller and processor shall take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor who has access to personal data does not process them except on instructions from the controller, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The processor shall notify the controller without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data breach. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall provide a notification that at least includes:

a) the nature of the personal data breach;
b) the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained;
c) the likely consequences of the personal data breach;
d) the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions that the organization has a policy explaining how it collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards personal data, but does not provide any specific information about a notification in case of a personal data breach. 
* There is no mention of the required elements (nature of the breach, contact details of the data protection officer, likely consequences, and measures to address the breach) in the provided evidence.
* The policy only addresses general data protection practices without specifically addressing the requirements for notifications following a personal data breach.

**Target Policy**: This policy explains 
how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal data in compliance with 
applicable data protection laws.




**Requirement**:

 Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide the information at the same time, the information may be provided in phases without undue further delay. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The controller shall document any personal data breaches, comprising the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects and the remedial action taken. That documentation shall enable the supervisory authority to verify compliance with this Article. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach to the affected data subject.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because, although the policy explains how the organization collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards personal data, it does not specifically address the nature of a personal data breach. The policy only provides a general overview of how the organization handles personal data in compliance with applicable data protection laws, without providing details on what constitutes a data breach or how the organization will notify affected data subjects.

**Target Policy**: This policy explains 
how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal data in compliance with 
applicable data protection laws.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall not require communication to be made to a data subject if any of the following conditions are met:

a) the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;
b) the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialise;
c) it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because this policy does not explicitly state that conditions a), b), and c) have been met for specific cases where communication to data subjects would otherwise be required.
* While the policy mentions implementing appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, it does not provide evidence of these measures being applied to affected personal data or render it unintelligible to unauthorized individuals.
* Similarly, there is no mention of subsequent measures being taken to mitigate risks or ensuring that high-risk situations are no longer likely to materialize.
* The policy also does not address whether specific cases would involve disproportionate effort and how public communication alternatives would be implemented in an equally effective manner.

**Target Policy**: This policy explains 
how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal data in compliance with 
applicable data protection laws.




**Requirement**:

 If the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a legal basis in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject, that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question, and a data protection impact assessment has already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it to be necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing activities. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing is performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment at least when there is a change of the risk represented by processing operations.

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where the supervisory authority is of the opinion that the intended processing referred to in paragraph 1 would infringe this Regulation, in particular where the controller has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, the supervisory authority shall, within period of up to eight weeks of receipt of the request for consultation, provide written advice to the controller and, where applicable to the processor, and may use any of its powers referred to in Article 58. That period may be extended by six weeks, taking into account the complexity of the intended processing. The supervisory authority shall inform the controller and, where applicable, the processor, of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request for consultation together with the reasons for the delay. Those periods may be suspended until the supervisory authority has obtained information it has requested for the purposes of the consultation.

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Notwithstanding paragraph 1, Member State law may require controllers to consult with, and obtain prior author­isation from, the supervisory authority in relation to processing by a controller for the performance of a task carried out by the controller in the public interest, including processing in relation to social protection and public health. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The controller and the processor shall designate a data protection officer in any case where:
(a) the processing is carried out by a public authority or body, except for courts acting in their judicial capacity;
(b) the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing operations which, by virtue of their nature, their scope and/or their purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale; or
(c) the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large scale of special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 and personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10.

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 In cases other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the controller or processor or associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may or, where required by Union or Member State law shall, designate a data protection officer. The data protection officer may act for such associations and other bodies representing controllers or processors. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The data protection officer shall be designated on the basis of professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge of data protection law and practices and the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The data protection officer may be a staff member of the controller or processor, or fulfil the tasks on the basis of a service contract. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The controller or the processor shall publish the contact details of the data protection officer and communicate them to the supervisory authority. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The controller and the processor shall ensure that the data protection officer is involved, properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions ensuring "appropriate safeguards are in place" when it comes to protecting personal data. While this suggests some level of involvement from the data protection officer, it does not explicitly state that they are involved properly and in a timely manner.
* The requirement specifically states that the data protection officer should be involved in all issues related to the protection of personal data, but the evidence only mentions specific mechanisms (standard contractual clauses or equivalent) for safeguarding data. It is unclear if these safeguards imply proper and timely involvement from the data protection officer.

**Target Policy**: In such cases, we ensure that appropriate 
safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent 
mechanisms, to protect your data.




**Requirement**:

 The controller and processor shall support the data protection officer in performing the tasks referred to in Article 39 by providing resources necessary to carry out those tasks and access to personal data and processing operations, and to maintain his or her expert knowledge. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The controller and processor shall ensure that the data protection officer does not receive any instructions regarding the exercise of those tasks. He or she shall not be dismissed or penalised by the controller or the processor for performing his tasks. The data protection officer shall directly report to the highest management level of the controller or the processor. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall ensure that data subjects can contact the data protection officer with regard to all issues related to processing of their personal data and to the exercise of their rights under this Regulation.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the legal basis for processing provided in the evidence only mentions "Consent" as one of the legal grounds, without mentioning contact with the data protection officer or exercising rights.
* Although the regulation explicitly requires organizations to have a mechanism for data subjects to exercise their rights, including contacting the data protection officer, the provided legal basis does not address this requirement.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:

The organization shall ensure that the Data Protection Officer (DPO) maintains confidentiality in accordance with Union or Member State law.

**Status**:
Requirement: Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is satisfied because the evidence provides a mechanism for controlling access to sensitive data, which implies adherence to confidentiality requirements. 
* The principle of least privilege ensures that only personnel with legitimate business needs can access confidential information, further supporting the implementation of confidentiality measures.
* Although there is no explicit mention of the DPO being bound by secrecy or confidentiality, the evidence's focus on role-based access control mechanisms and access control generally implies adherence to relevant laws and regulations.

**Target Policy**: Access to sensitive data 
is strictly controlled through role-based access control mechanisms and the principle of 
least privilege, ensuring that only personnel with legitimate business requirements can 
access confidential information.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall ensure that the role of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) does not create a conflict of interests with other tasks and duties.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions "security controls and practices" but does not explicitly mention how these controls prevent potential conflicts of interest for the DPO.
* While the document does outline roles and responsibilities, it does not provide information on ensuring that other tasks and duties do not conflict with the role of the DPO.

**Target Policy**: It outlines the security controls and 
practices designed to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with legal, 
regulatory, and contractual obligations.




**Requirement**:
The data protection officer shall have at least the following tasks:

a) to inform and advise the controller or the processor and the employees who carry out processing of their obligations pursuant to this Regulation and to other Union or Member State data protection provisions;
b) to monitor compliance with this Regulation, with other Union or Member State data protection provisions and with the policies of the controller or processor in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing operations, and the related audits;
c) to provide advice where requested as regards the data protection impact assessment and monitor its performance pursuant to Article 35;
d) to cooperate with the supervisory authority;
e) to act as the contact point for the supervisory authority on issues relating to processing, including the prior consultation referred to in Article 36, and to consult, where appropriate, with regard to any other matter.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The reason for this conclusion is that the requirement is not explicitly stated as being satisfied. The evidence provided only outlines security controls and practices designed to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations, but it does not provide information on whether the specific tasks listed in the requirement are being carried out by the data protection officer.

**Target Policy**: It outlines the security controls and 
practices designed to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with legal, 
regulatory, and contractual obligations.




**Requirement**:

 The data protection officer shall in the performance of his or her tasks have due regard to the risk associated with processing operations, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission shall encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct intended to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking account of the specific features of the various processing sectors and the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The Commission shall ensure appropriate publicity for the approved codes which have been decided as having general validity in accordance with paragraph 9. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The Board shall collate all approved codes of conduct, amendments and extensions in a register and shall make them publicly available by way of appropriate means. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

Associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may prepare codes of conduct, or amend or extend such codes, for the purpose of specifying the application of this Regulation, as outlined in points (a) to (k).

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

The requirement is not satisfied because there is no evidence that associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors have prepared codes of conduct or amended existing ones. The legal basis for processing personal data mentioned in the provided text only includes "Consent" as one of the legal grounds, but does not mention any codes of conduct from these associations.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:
The organization shall make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply appropriate safeguards including with regard to the rights of data subjects when personal data transfers to third countries or international organisations under the terms referred to in point (e) of Article 46(2).

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because while the evidence mentions standard contractual clauses as a mechanism for safeguarding data, it does not explicitly state that binding and enforceable commitments are being made. The phrase "we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place" implies a general commitment to data protection, but it does not specify whether these safeguards are legally binding or enforceable.

**Target Policy**: In such cases, we ensure that appropriate 
safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent 
mechanisms, to protect your data.




**Requirement**:

 A code of conduct referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall contain mechanisms which enable the body referred to in Article 41(1) to carry out the mandatory monitoring of compliance with its provisions by the controllers or processors which undertake to apply it, without prejudice to the tasks and powers of supervisory authorities competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56.

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where the draft code, or amendment or extension is approved in accordance with paragraph 5, and where the code of conduct concerned does not relate to processing activities in several Member States, the supervisory authority shall register and publish the code. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where a draft code of conduct relates to processing activities in several Member States, the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 55 shall, before approving the draft code, amendment or extension, submit it in the procedure referred to in Article 63 to the Board which shall provide an opinion on whether the draft code, amendment or extension complies with this Regulation or, in the situation referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, provides appropriate safeguards. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where the opinion referred to in paragraph 7 confirms that the draft code, amendment or extension complies with this Regulation, or, in the situation referred to in paragraph 3, provides appropriate safeguards, the Board shall submit its opinion to the Commission.

**Requirement**:

The organization shall encourage, in particular at Union level, the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with this Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors. The specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises shall be taken into account.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* Although the evidence mentions security controls and practices designed to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations, it does not explicitly mention encouraging the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks at Union level.
* The requirement specifically states that the organization should encourage the establishment of these mechanisms, but the provided evidence only mentions taking specific needs into account.

**Target Policy**: It outlines the security controls and 
practices designed to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with legal, 
regulatory, and contractual obligations.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall establish and maintain data protection certification mechanisms, seals or marks approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of Article 5 of the Regulation, to demonstrate the existence of appropriate safeguards provided by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regulation.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because, although the organization mentions having "standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms" in place, it does not explicitly state that these mechanisms meet the requirements outlined in paragraph 5 of Article 5 of the Regulation. Furthermore, the text does not provide information on how these mechanisms are approved or recognized by a designated authority, which is typically necessary for data protection certification mechanisms to be considered valid under the Regulation.

**Target Policy**: In such cases, we ensure that appropriate 
safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent 
mechanisms, to protect your data.




**Requirement**:

 The certification shall be voluntary and available via a process that is transparent. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 A certification pursuant to this Article does not reduce the responsibility of the controller or the processor for
compliance with this Regulation and is without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the supervisory authorities which are competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall obtain a certification pursuant to this Article from one of the following bodies:

a) certification bodies referred to in Article 43;
b) the competent supervisory authority; or
c) the Board, where applicable.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only mentions a "review of regulatory compliance status and industry certifications", but does not explicitly state that a certification has been obtained from one of the specified bodies.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Review of regulatory compliance status and industry certifications.




**Requirement**:

 The controller or processor which submits its processing to the certification mechanism shall provide the certification body referred to in Article 43, or where applicable, the competent supervisory authority, with all information and access to its processing activities which are necessary to conduct the certification procedure. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Certification shall be issued to a controller or processor for a maximum period of three years and may be renewed, under the same conditions, provided that the relevant requirements continue to be met. Certification shall be withdrawn, as applicable, by the certification bodies referred to in Article 43 or by the competent supervisory authority where the requirements for the certification are not or are no longer met. 

 **Status**: Missing

**Requirement**:

 Any transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country or to an international organisation shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the controller and processor, including for onward transfers of personal data from the third country or an international organisation to another third country or to another international organisation. All provisions in this Chapter shall be applied in order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by this Regulation is not undermined. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation may take place where the Commission has decided that the third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the international organisation in question ensures an adequate level of protection. Such a transfer shall not require any specific authorisation. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The Commission shall take account of the following elements when assessing the adequacy of the level of protection:

(a) the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, relevant legislation, both general and sectoral, including concerning public security, defence, national security and criminal law and the access of public authorities to personal data, as well as the implementation of such legislation, data protection rules, professional rules and security measures, including rules for the onward transfer of personal data to another third country or international organisation which are complied with in that country or international organisation, case-law, as well as effective and enforceable data subject rights and effective administrative and judicial redress for the data subjects whose personal data are being transferred;

(b) the existence and effective functioning of one or more independent supervisory authorities in the third country or to which an international organisation is subject, with responsibility for ensuring and enforcing compliance with the data protection rules, including adequate enforcement powers, for assisting and advising the data subjects in exercising their rights and for cooperation with the supervisory authorities of the Member States; and

(c) the international commitments the third country or international organisation concerned has entered into, or other obligations arising from legally binding conventions or instruments as well as from its participation in multilateral or regional systems, in particular in relation to the protection of personal data.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only outlines security controls and practices designed to protect sensitive data, without explicitly mentioning the consideration of "the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms" (element a).
* Additionally, there is no mention of the existence and effective functioning of independent supervisory authorities or international commitments related to personal data protection.
* While the evidence does indicate compliance with legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations, it does not explicitly demonstrate that these requirements are being taken into account when assessing the adequacy of the level of protection.

**Target Policy**: It outlines the security controls and 
practices designed to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with legal, 
regulatory, and contractual obligations.




**Requirement**:

 The Commission, after assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, may decide, by means of implementing act, that a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within a third country, or an international organisation ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article. The implementing act shall provide for a mechanism for a periodic review, at least every four years, which shall take into account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation. The implementing act shall specify its territorial and sectoral application and, where applicable, identify the supervisory authority or authorities referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article. The implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2).

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union and on its website a list of the third countries, territories and specified sectors within a third country and international organisations for which it has decided that an adequate level of protection is or is no longer ensured. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Decisions adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed by a Commission Decision adopted in accordance with paragraph 3 or 5 of this Article.

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 In the absence of a decision pursuant to Article 45(3), a controller or processor may transfer personal data to a third country or an international organisation only if the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall provide appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 without requiring any specific authorization from a supervisory authority, using at least one of the following mechanisms:

(a) a legally binding and enforceable instrument between public authorities or bodies;
(b) binding corporate rules in accordance with Article 47;
(c) standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2);
(d) standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority and approved by the Commission pursuant to the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2);
(e) an approved code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 together with binding and enforceable commitments of the controller or processor in the third country to apply the appropriate safeguards, including as regards data subjects' rights; or
(f) an approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 together with binding and enforceable commitments of the controller or processor in the third country to apply the appropriate safeguards, including as regards data subjects' rights.

**Status**: 
Requirement: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The organization's statement only mentions "standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms" without explicitly mentioning one of the specified mechanisms (as listed in the requirement).
* There is no clear indication that any of the specific mechanisms listed in the requirement are being used to provide appropriate safeguards.

**Target Policy**: In such cases, we ensure that appropriate 
safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent 
mechanisms, to protect your data.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect personal data, including contractual clauses and equivalent mechanisms.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
Although the requirement mentions that "appropriate safeguards" should be in place, it does not specify what exactly these safeguards entail. The evidence provided only mentions standard contractual clauses as one mechanism for ensuring appropriateness of data protection measures, but does not mention other potential safeguards or mechanisms that may be required by regulation (e.g., provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements between public authorities).

**Target Policy**: In such cases, we ensure that appropriate 
safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent 
mechanisms, to protect your data.




**Requirement**:

 The supervisory authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 in the cases referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.

**Requirement**:

 Authorisations by a Member State or supervisory authority on the basis of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain valid until amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by that supervisory authority. Decisions adopted by the Commission on the basis of Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC shall remain in force until amended, replaced or repealed, if necessary, by a Commission Decision adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The competent supervisory authority shall approve binding corporate rules in accordance with the consistency mechanism set out in Article 63, provided that they:
(a) are legally binding and apply to and are enforced by every member concerned of the group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, including their employees;
(b) expressly confer enforceable rights on data subjects with regard to the processing of their personal data; and
(c) fulfil the requirements laid down in paragraph 2. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall specify at least:

(a) the structure and contact details of the group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity and of each of its members;
(b) the data transfers or set of transfers, including the categories of personal data, the type of processing and its purposes, the type of data subjects affected and the identification of the third country or countries in question;
(c) their legally binding nature, both internally and externally;
(d) the application of the general data protection principles, in particular purpose limitation, data minimisation, limited storage periods, data quality, data protection by design and by default, legal basis for processing, processing of special categories of personal data, measures to ensure data security, and the requirements in respect of onward transfers to bodies not bound by the binding corporate rules;
(e) the rights of data subjects in regard to processing and the means to exercise those rights, including the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling in accordance with Article 22, the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority and before the competent courts of the Member States in accordance with Article 79, and to obtain redress and, where appropriate, compensation for a breach of the binding corporate rules;
(f) the acceptance by the controller or processor established on the territory of a Member State of liability for any breaches of the binding corporate rules by any member concerned not established in the Union; the controller or the processor shall be exempt from that liability, in whole or in part, only if it proves that that member is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage;
(g) how the information on the binding corporate rules, in particular on the provisions referred to in points (d), (e) and (f) of this paragraph is provided to the data subjects in addition to Articles 13 and 14;
(h) the tasks of any data protection officer designated in accordance with Article 37 or any other person or entity in charge of the monitoring compliance with the binding corporate rules within the group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, as well as monitoring training and complaint-handling;
(i) the complaint procedures;
(j) the mechanisms within the group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity for ensuring the verification of compliance with the binding corporate rules. Such mechanisms shall include data protection audits and methods for ensuring corrective actions to protect the rights of the data subject. Results of such verification should be communicated to the person or entity referred to in point (h) and to the board of the controlling undertaking of a group of undertakings, or of the group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, and should be available upon request to the competent supervisory authority;
(k) the mechanisms for reporting and recording changes to the rules and reporting those changes to the supervisory authority;
(l) the cooperation mechanism with the supervisory authority to ensure compliance by any member of the group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, in particular by making available to the supervisory authority the results of verifications of the measures referred to in point (j);
(m) the mechanisms for reporting to the competent supervisory authority any legal requirements to which a member of the group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity is subject in a third country which are likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the guarantees provided by the binding corporate rules; and
(n) the appropriate data protection training to personnel having permanent or regular access to personal data.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
Although the text mentions "appropriate safeguards" such as standard contractual clauses, it does not explicitly specify all the requirements listed in (a) to (n). Specifically, it lacks details on the structure and contact details of each member, as well as specific information about how data protection principles are applied.

**Target Policy**: In such cases, we ensure that appropriate 
safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent 
mechanisms, to protect your data.




**Requirement**:

 The Commission may specify the format and procedures for the exchange of information between controllers, processors and supervisory authorities for binding corporate rules within the meaning of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure set out in Article 93(2). 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Any judgment of a court or tribunal and any decision of an administrative authority of a third country requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data may only be recognised or enforceable in any manner if based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member State, without prejudice to other grounds for transfer pursuant to this Chapter. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall take appropriate safeguards when transferring personal data to a third country or an international organisation, including binding corporate rules, in accordance with Article 46 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because, although the text mentions "appropriate safeguards" and refers to standard contractual clauses as one such mechanism, it does not explicitly mention the use of binding corporate rules or equivalent mechanisms for all transfers.
* While the statement suggests that some level of safeguarding is in place, it does not provide sufficient evidence to confirm that all required safeguards are implemented consistently across all data transfers.

**Target Policy**: In such cases, we ensure that appropriate 
safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent 
mechanisms, to protect your data.




**Requirement**:

 A transfer pursuant to point (g) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire categories of the personal data contained in the register. Where the register is intended for consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer shall be made only at the request of those persons or if they are to be the recipients. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and the second subparagraph thereof shall not apply to activities carried out by public authorities in the exercise of their public powers. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The public interest referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be recognised in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 In the absence of an adequacy decision, Union or Member State law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly set limits to the transfer of specific categories of personal data to a third country or an international organisation. Member States shall notify such provisions to the Commission. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 The controller or processor shall document the assessment as well as the suitable safeguards referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article in the records referred to in Article 30. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

Personal data shall be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’);

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

The requirement is not satisfied because the organization does not provide any evidence of implementing "appropriate technical or organisational measures" to ensure security of personal data. The request for limitations on processing personal data suggests that the organization may be taking steps to limit their data collection and processing, but it does not indicate the presence of adequate security measures in place.

**Target Policy**: Request limitations on the processing of
your personal data.




**Requirement**:

 The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’). 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies:

(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;
(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
(c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
(d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
(e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided does not demonstrate that the organization has obtained consent from data subjects for specific purposes or that processing is necessary and lawful for legitimate interests pursued by the controller.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Legal Obligation: When processing is required to comply with legal obligations 
(e.g., financial or tax requirements).




**Requirement**:

 Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:

a) Union law; or
b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because, although the organization mentions "applicable data protection laws" as the legal basis for processing personal data, it does not explicitly state that this basis is Union law (option a) or Member State law to which the controller is subject (option b).
* The evidence provided only mentions specific examples of legal grounds used by the organization, such as "Consent", but does not provide information on the broader legal basis that applies to all processing activities.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:

Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take into account, inter alia:

(a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended further processing;
(b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller;
(c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article 10;
(d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects;
(e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

The requirement is not satisfied because there is no clear indication that the organization has taken into account all the necessary factors when deciding whether to process personal data for a purpose other than initially collected. The provided evidence only mentions "Consent" as one of the legal grounds for processing, but it does not provide information on how the organization assesses compatibility with the initial purpose.

The text does not explicitly mention considering the link between purposes, context, nature of data, possible consequences, or existence of safeguards in its decision-making process. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the organization has satisfied this requirement.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:

The organization shall be able to demonstrate that when processing is based on consent, the controller has obtained the data subject's consent.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

The requirement is not satisfied because although the organization mentions "Consent" as a legal ground for processing personal data, it does not explicitly state how they obtain and verify the data subject's consent. The evidence only provides examples of situations where consent was given (e.g., marketing communications), but it does not explain the process or mechanism used to obtain and confirm consent in other situations.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:
The organization shall present requests for consent in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from other matters, using clear and plain language.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: The requirement is not satisfied because the provided evidence states that consent is given through a "written declaration" that also concerns other matters. Although it mentions presenting the request for consent in an intelligible form, it does not explicitly state that this request will be presented clearly distinguishable from the other matters.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:
The organization shall ensure that the data subject has the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time, and that this withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because while the text mentions "Right to Withdraw Consent", it does not explicitly state what procedures DANFECORP will follow when a data subject withdraws their consent. There is no mention of how the organization will handle this situation, or whether they have implemented any measures to ensure that withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing.
* Although the text mentions prior notification requirements for consent (i.e., informing the data subject before giving consent), it does not address the issue of withdrawing consent.

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall ensure that every data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in case of suspected infringement of personal data processing, as per Regulation XXXX.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the legal basis for processing mentions "Consent" as one of the grounds, but it does not explicitly mention the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. 
* The regulation specifically states that data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in case of suspected infringement of personal data processing.
* Although the organization provides legal grounds for processing, it does not directly address the requirement for providing a mechanism for data subjects to file complaints with supervisory authorities.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).

**Requirement**:

 Proceedings against a controller or a processor shall be brought before the courts of the Member State where the controller or processor has an establishment. Alternatively, such proceedings may be brought before the courts of the Member State where the data subject has his or her habitual residence, unless the controller or processor is a public authority of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 years. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.

**Requirement**:
The organization shall ensure that data subjects have the right to lodge complaints with a not-for-profit body, organization, or association in accordance with the law of a Member State.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only provides information on the individual rights of data subjects (e.g. Right to Access, Right to Rectification, etc.) but does not mention any mechanism for data subjects to lodge complaints with an external organization. While the text does provide a description of what happens when a complaint is lodged by the Data Protection Officer, it does not explicitly state that this process involves a not-for-profit body or association as required by the regulation.

**Requirement**:

 Member States may provide that any body, organisation or association referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, in­ dependently of a data subject's mandate, has the right to lodge, in that Member State, a complaint with the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 77 and to exercise the rights referred to in Articles 78 and 79 if it considers that the rights of a data subject under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall disclose personal data in official documents held by a public authority or a public body or a private body for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, in accordance with Union or Member State law.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the provided evidence only mentions legal grounds for processing personal data (e.g., consent), but does not mention anything about disclosing personal data in official documents for tasks carried out in the public interest.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:

 Member States may further determine the specific conditions for the processing of a national identification number or any other identifier of general application. In that case the national identification number or any other identifier of general application shall be used only under appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject pursuant to this Regulation. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Member States may, by law or by collective agreements, provide for more specific rules to ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms in respect of the processing of employees' personal data in the employment context, in particular for the purposes of the recruitment, the performance of the contract of employment, including discharge of obligations laid down by law or by collective agreements, management, planning and organisation of work, equality and diversity in the workplace, health and safety at work, protection of employer's or customer's property and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment, on an individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to employment, and for the purpose of the termination of the employment relationship.

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall include suitable and specific measures to safeguard the data subject's human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights, with particular regard to the transparency of processing, the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity and monitoring systems at the work place.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only mentions "standard contractual clauses" as an example of a safeguard to protect data. While standard contractual clauses are a common practice for protecting personal data, they do not explicitly address all aspects mentioned in the requirement.
* The requirement specifies measures to safeguard human dignity, legitimate interests, and fundamental rights, which is not directly supported by the provided evidence.
* Furthermore, the evidence does not provide any information on monitoring systems at the workplace or the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings, which are also mentioned in the requirement.

**Target Policy**: In such cases, we ensure that appropriate 
safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent 
mechanisms, to protect your data.




**Requirement**:

 Each Member State shall notify to the Commission those provisions of its law which it adopts pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment affecting them.

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to appropriate safeguards, in accordance with this Regulation, for the rights and freedoms of the data subject. Those safeguards shall ensure that technical and organisational measures are in place in particular in order to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation. Those measures may include pseudonymisation provided that those purposes can be fulfilled in that manner. Where those purposes can be fulfilled by further processing which does not permit or no longer permits the identification of data subjects, those purposes shall be fulfilled in that manner.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement specifies that technical and organisational measures are necessary to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation.
* However, the provided evidence only mentions "any operation performed on personal data", which does not explicitly mention any safeguards or measures to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects, particularly in relation to archiving purposes.

**Target Policy**: Any operation performed on personal data, including collection,
storage, retrieval, alteration, or deletion.




**Requirement**:

 Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in Articles 15, 16, 18 and 21 subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in so far as such rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the specific purposes, and such derogations are necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where personal data are processed for archiving purposes in the public interest, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in Articles 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 21 subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in so far as such rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the specific purposes, and such derogations are necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Where processing referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 serves at the same time another purpose, the derogations shall apply only to processing for the purposes referred to in those paragraphs. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall not process personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.

**Status**:
Requirement: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because the organization processes personal data based on legal grounds other than those listed in the requirement (e.g., consent).
* Specifically, the organization mentions "Consent" as a legal ground for processing personal data, but this is a separate basis from those explicitly prohibited by the requirement.
* There is no indication that the organization intends to stop processing personal data for these specific reasons.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:
The organization shall not apply paragraph 1 if one of the exceptions in article 6(1)(a)-(j) of the GDPR applies.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* Although the text mentions "Legal Basis for Processing" and provides an explanation for consent, it does not explicitly state that none of the exceptions in article 6(1)(a)-(j) apply.
* The provided legal basis only mentions "Consent", which is one of the exceptions mentioned in paragraph 1. However, this exception should be read together with the other exceptions listed in paragraph 1.
* Therefore, without further information on whether any of the other exceptions (b)-(j) are applicable, it cannot be concluded that none of these apply, and thus the requirement is not satisfied.

**Target Policy**: Legal Basis for Processing 
Under applicable data protection laws, we process personal data based on the following 
legal grounds: 
●​ Consent: Where you have provided explicit consent for specific purposes (e.g., 
marketing communications).




**Requirement**:
The organization shall process personal data for specific purposes, as specified in point (h) of paragraph 2, only when that data are processed by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to an obligation of professional secrecy.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only mentions "the individual whose personal data is being processed", without specifying the purpose of processing (point (h) of paragraph 2).
* The text does not mention whether the processing is subject to an obligation of professional secrecy.
* It appears that the organization has identified an individual, but it is unclear if the processing is for a specific purpose and if there is an obligation of secrecy in place.

**Target Policy**: The individual whose personal data is being processed.




**Requirement**:

 Member States may maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health.

(1) Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all electronic protected health information the covered entity or business associate creates, receives, maintains, or transmits.
(2) Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information.
(3) Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are not permitted or required under subpart E of this part.
(4) Ensure compliance with this subpart by its workforce. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Flexibility of approach.
(1) Covered entities and business associates may use any security measures that allow the covered entity or business associate to reasonably and appropriately implement the standards and implementation specifications as specified in this subpart.
(2) In deciding which security measures to use, a covered entity or business associate must take into account the following factors:
(2)(i) The size, complexity, and capabilities of the covered entity or business associate.
(2)(ii) The covered entity's or the business associate's technical infrastructure, hardware, and software security capabilities.
(2)(iii) The costs of security measures.
(2)(iv) The probability and criticality of potential risks to electronic protected health information. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Standards. A covered entity or business associate must comply with the applicable standards as provided in this section and in §§164.308, 164.310, 164.312, 164.314 and 164.316 with respect to all electronic protected health information. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Implementation specifications. In this subpart:
(1) Implementation specifications are required or addressable. If an implementation specification is required, the word "Required" appears in parentheses after the title of the implementation specification. If an implementation specification is addressable, the word "Addressable" appears in parentheses after the title of the implementation specification.
(2) When a standard adopted in §164.308, §164.310, §164.312, §164.314, or §164.316 includes required implementation specifications, a covered entity or business associate must implement the implementation specifications.
(3) When a standard adopted in §164.308, §164.310, §164.312, §164.314, or §164.316 includes addressable implementation specifications, a covered entity or business associate must—
(3)(i) Assess whether each implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard in its environment, when analyzed with reference to the likely contribution to protecting electronic protected health information; and
(3)(ii) As applicable to the covered entity or business associate—
(3)(ii)(A) Implement the implementation specification if reasonable and appropriate; or
(3)(ii)(B) If implementing the implementation specification is not reasonable and appropriate—
(3)(ii)(B) Document why it would not be reasonable and appropriate to implement the implementation specification; and
(3)(ii)(B) Implement an equivalent alternative measure if reasonable and appropriate. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Maintenance. A covered entity or business associate must review and modify the security measures implemented under this subpart as needed to continue provision of reasonable and appropriate protection of electronic protected health information, and update documentation of such security measures in accordance with §164.316(b)(2)(iii). 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
A covered entity or business associate must, in accordance with §164.306:

* Standard: Security management process.
* Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions identifying "security and compliance requirements", which does not explicitly mention implementing policies and procedures to address security violations.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Identify security and compliance requirements.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity or business associate.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
Although the risk assessments do include evaluating the vendor's security controls and policies, this does not necessarily mean that a comprehensive assessment of the organization's own risks and vulnerabilities is conducted. The requirement specifically states "accurate and thorough", which suggests a level of detail and scope beyond just evaluating third-party vendors' security measures.

**Target Policy**: Risk assessments include: 
●​ Evaluation of the vendor's security controls and policies.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with §164.306(a), as part of risk management.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 
The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions "Identify security and compliance requirements", which does not explicitly indicate that the organization has implemented security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Identify security and compliance requirements.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement a sanction policy that applies appropriate sanctions against workforce members who fail to comply with the security policies and procedures of the covered entity or business associate.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:
Although the evidence mentions "rigorous compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards", it does not explicitly state that a sanction policy has been implemented. The requirement specifies the need for an implementation specification, which is missing in the provided evidence.

**Target Policy**: This policy further aims to establish rigorous compliance with 
relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards regarding data protection and 
information security, including but not limited to privacy regulations and sector-specific 
requirements.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement procedures for regularly reviewing records of information system activity, such as audit logs, access reports, and security incident tracking reports.

**Status**: 
Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 
Although the text mentions conducting regular audits and continuous monitoring to ensure compliance with the policy and detect any security gaps, it does not explicitly mention implementing procedures specifically for regularly reviewing records of information system activity. The evidence primarily focuses on auditing and monitoring in general, rather than detailing a specific process for reviewing records of activity.

**Target Policy**: Regular audits and continuous
monitoring of information systems will

Auditing and Monitoring be conducted to ensure compliance
with this policy and detect any security
gaps.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall identify:

* The security official who is responsible for the development and implementation of policies and procedures required by this subpart for the covered entity or business associate.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* Although the evidence mentions a specific "IT Security Team" with responsibilities for maintaining network security, it does not explicitly identify a single individual as the assigned security official. 
* The requirement specifically asks for the identification of a "security official", which is not clearly present in the provided evidence.

**Target Policy**: Roles and Responsibilities 
The following roles have specific responsibilities for maintaining network security: 
●​ IT Security Team: Oversees network security, monitors for threats, and enforces 
compliance.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement policies and procedures to ensure that all members of its workforce have appropriate access to electronic protected health information.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only describes the security infrastructure's ability to limit data access based on job responsibilities and regular permission reviews, but it does not explicitly mention implementing policies and procedures for workforce members without authorized access.
* Although the infrastructure is sophisticated, the lack of explicit mention of workforce-specific policies and procedures raises concerns that the organization may not have adequately addressed this requirement.

**Target Policy**: Our security 
infrastructure includes sophisticated access control mechanisms that strictly limit data 
access to authorized personnel based on job responsibilities and the principle of least 
privilege, with regular permission reviews and updates as roles change.




**Requirement**:

 Implementation specifications:
Authorization and/or supervision (Addressable). Implement procedures for the authorization and/or supervision of workforce members who work with electronic protected health information or in locations where it might be accessed. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Implementation specifications:
Workforce clearance procedure (Addressable). Implement procedures to determine that the access of a workforce member to electronic protected health information is appropriate. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Implementation specifications:
Termination procedures (Addressable). Implement procedures for terminating access to electronic protected health information when the employment of, or other arrangement with, a workforce member ends or as required by determinations made as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement policies and procedures for authorizing access to electronic protected health information that are consistent with the applicable requirements of subpart E of this part.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because while the policy mentions compliance with "relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards", it does not specifically state that it follows the requirements of subpart E.
* The text also uses general terms such as "including but not limited to" which suggests that the organization may be following some requirements from subpart E, but it does not explicitly confirm consistency.

**Target Policy**: This policy further aims to establish rigorous compliance with 
relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards regarding data protection and 
information security, including but not limited to privacy regulations and sector-specific 
requirements.




**Requirement**:

 Implementation specifications:
Isolating health care clearinghouse functions (Required). If a health care clearinghouse is part of a larger organization, the clearinghouse must implement policies and procedures that protect the electronic protected health information of the clearinghouse from unauthorized access by the larger organization. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Implementation specifications:
Access authorization (Addressable). Implement policies and procedures for granting access to electronic protected health information, for example, through access to a workstation, transaction, program, process, or other mechanism. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Implementation specifications:
Access establishment and modification (Addressable). Implement policies and procedures that, based upon the covered entity's or the business associate's access authorization policies, establish, document, review, and modify a user's right of access to a workstation, transaction, program, or process. 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall implement a security awareness and training program for all members of its workforce, including management.

**Status**:

**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because the text does not explicitly state that such a program has been implemented or that it will be mandatory.
 
  * It mentions only that "security awareness and compliance requirements" are part of the security policies and procedures. While this suggests that training may be included, it's unclear whether management is specifically required to undergo the training.

**Target Policy**: Security Awareness and Training 
 
6.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement:

a) Security reminders that are addressable by all personnel;
b) Periodic security updates to ensure the information security management system remains current.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because, although the evidence provided mentions "Vendor security notifications and patch releases", it does not explicitly mention the implementation of security reminders that are addressable by all personnel.
* While periodic security updates are mentioned, there is no clear indication that this includes security reminders for all personnel. 

Note: There might be other requirements or clauses that address these aspects but based on provided evidence they are not covered.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Vendor security notifications and patch releases.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement:

a) Protection from malicious software (Addressable);
b) Procedures for guarding against, detecting, and reporting malicious software.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions that systems undergo "rigorous hardening procedures" after removing malicious elements, but it does not explicitly mention implementing protection from malicious software as a standalone procedure.
* While the organization does implement measures to strengthen network security parameters and enhance access controls, these are not directly mentioned as procedures for guarding against, detecting, and reporting malicious software.

**Target Policy**: Once malicious elements have been 
removed, systems undergo rigorous hardening procedures, including the application of 
all relevant security patches, comprehensive update of system configurations to 
address identified vulnerabilities, implementation of enhanced access controls, and 
strengthening of network security parameters.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement:

a) Log-in monitoring procedures;
b) Procedures for reporting discrepancies in log-in attempts.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Identify security and compliance requirements.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement policies and procedures to address security incidents.

**Status**:
Requirement: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions updating security measures in response to findings from a review, but does not explicitly state that new policies and procedures have been implemented specifically for addressing security incidents. While this may be an indication of progress towards implementing security incident procedures, more explicit information on the implementation of these procedures would be needed to confirm satisfaction of the requirement.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Updating Security Measures: Findings from the review will be used to update 
security policies, incident response procedures, and controls to prevent future 
incidents.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall identify and respond to suspected or known security incidents; mitigate, to the extent practicable, harmful effects of security incidents that are known to the covered entity or business associate; and document security incidents and their outcomes.

**Status**:
**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

**Status**:
**Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:
The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions securing devices used to access sensitive information, but does not provide any details on specifying proper functions, manner of performance, and physical attributes of the surroundings. The requirement specifically states that these aspects need to be addressed through policies and procedures.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Workstation Security: Devices used to access sensitive information must be 
secured.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement physical safeguards for all workstations that access electronic protected health information, to restrict access to authorized users.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions "Devices used to access sensitive information must be secured", but does not explicitly state that physical safeguards will be implemented.
* Although the text does mention physical security for devices, it does not specifically address workstations, which are likely a separate type of device.
* Therefore, based on the provided evidence, the requirement is not met.

**Target Policy**: ●​ Workstation Security: Devices used to access sensitive information must be 
secured.

decryption.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement audit controls, including hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use electronic protected health information.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 
* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions "Regular audits and continuous monitoring of information systems" without mentioning specific mechanisms such as hardware, software, or procedures to record and examine activity.

**Target Policy**: Regular audits and continuous
monitoring of information systems will

Auditing and Monitoring be conducted to ensure compliance
with this policy and detect any security
gaps.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement policies and procedures to protect electronic protected health information from improper alteration or destruction.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**: 

* The evidence only mentions that the practices "collectively ensure maintenance of data availability and integrity" but does not explicitly state that these measures are in place to protect against improper alteration or destruction specifically for electronic protected health information.
* Although the phrase "electronic protected health information" is mentioned, it appears to be part of a broader statement rather than a specific policy aimed at protecting this type of data from tampering.

**Target Policy**: These practices collectively ensure maintenance of data availability and 
integrity across the organization, protecting against accidental loss, corruption, or 
unauthorized modification of critical business information.




**Requirement**:

 Implementation specification: Mechanism to authenticate electronic protected health information (Addressable). Implement electronic mechanisms to corroborate that electronic protected health information has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.

The organization shall implement:

a) security measures to prevent unauthorized modification of electronically transmitted electronic protected health information;
b) detection mechanisms to identify any unauthorized modifications;
c) procedures for disposing of modified or outdated information securely;

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* Although the requirement mentions implementing security measures, the evidence only outlines security controls and practices designed to protect sensitive data without specifying how these measures will prevent unauthorized modification.
* The phrase "until disposed of" implies that some level of detection is in place, but it does not explicitly state how modifications are detected or addressed.

**Target Policy**: It outlines the security controls and 
practices designed to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with legal, 
regulatory, and contractual obligations.




**Requirement**:

 Implementation specifications:
Encryption (Addressable). Implement a mechanism to encrypt electronic protected health information whenever deemed appropriate.

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:

 Standard—
Breaches treated as discovered. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, §§164.406(a), and 164.408(a), a breach shall be treated as discovered by a covered entity as of the first day on which such breach is known to the covered entity, or, by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known to the covered entity. A covered entity shall be deemed to have knowledge of a breach if such breach is known, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person, other than the person committing the breach, who is a workforce member or agent of the covered entity (determined in accordance with the federal common law of agency). 

 **Status**: Missing 

**Reason**: 

The requirement is missing.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall provide notification required by paragraph (a) of §164.412 without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of a breach.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence only mentions an obligation for vendors to report security incidents within a defined timeframe, but it does not address the organization's own notification obligations under §164.412.
* While the timeline for vendor reporting may be more flexible than the 60-day threshold for organizational notification, it still does not provide clear evidence that the organization meets its own notification requirements.

**Target Policy**: Incident Notification

Obligation for vendors to report security
incidents within a defined timeframe.




**Requirement**:

The notification required by paragraph (a) of this section shall include, to the extent possible:

The requirement is not satisfied because the evidence provided only mentions an obligation for vendors to report security incidents within a defined timeframe, but it does not mention the organization's specific responsibility to provide notifications as stated in §164.412.

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because there is no evidence that the organization has considered delaying notifications in response to statements from law enforcement officials. While the obligation for vendors to report security incidents within a defined timeframe is mentioned, it does not address the specific scenario of delaying notifications due to a statement from a law enforcement official.
* There is no clear indication that the organization has documented such statements or had a process in place to delay notifications without a written statement being submitted during the delayed period.

**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement a policy that specifies permitted purposes for uses and disclosures of protected health information.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because the provided evidence only mentions the general principles of collecting, using, disclosing, and safeguarding personal data, but does not specifically address permitted purposes for uses and disclosures of protected health information.
* Although the policy is related to protecting personal data, it appears to be more focused on a broader scope of data protection rather than specifically addressing the requirements for protected health information in the context of HIPAA.

**Target Policy**: This policy explains 
how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal data in compliance with 
applicable data protection laws.




**Requirement**:
The organization shall implement a data use agreement that meets the requirements specified in this section for the use and disclosure of limited data sets under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because, although the evidence mentions standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms to protect data, it does not explicitly state that these agreements meet the requirements specified in this section. There is no clear indication that the organization has conducted a thorough review of its data use agreements to ensure they comply with all applicable requirements.
* Additionally, the phrase "in such cases" suggests that this measure may only be implemented under certain circumstances, rather than being an ongoing requirement for all use and disclosure of limited data sets.

**Target Policy**: In such cases, we ensure that appropriate 
safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent 
mechanisms, to protect your data.




**Requirement**:

The organization shall establish a data use agreement between the covered entity and the limited data set recipient that includes:

(A) Establishing permitted uses and disclosures of information consistent with paragraph (e)(3) of this section;
(B) Establishing who is permitted to use or receive the limited data set;
(C)(1) Not using or further disclosing the information other than as permitted by the data use agreement or as otherwise required by law;
(C)(2) Using appropriate safeguards to prevent use or disclosure of the information other than as provided for by the data use agreement;
(C)(3) Reporting to the covered entity any use or disclosure of the information not provided for by its data use agreement of which it becomes aware;
(C)(4) Ensuring that any agents to whom it provides the limited data set agree to the same restrictions and conditions that apply to the limited data set recipient with respect to such information; and
(C)(5) Not identifying the information or contact the individuals.

**Status**: **Not Satisfied**

**Reason**:

* The requirement is not satisfied because, although the organization mentions "standard contractual clauses or equivalent mechanisms" as a means of protecting data, it does not explicitly state that these agreements include all the elements required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
* Specifically, there is no mention of ensuring that any agents to whom they provide the limited data set agree to the same restrictions and conditions, which is an essential element of the requirement.

**Target Policy**: In such cases, we ensure that appropriate 
safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent 
mechanisms, to protect your data.




**Requirement**:

Implementation specifications: Data use agreement—
Compliance.
(A) A covered entity is not in compliance with the standards in paragraph (e) of this section if the covered entity knew of a pattern of activity or practice of the limited data set recipient that constituted a material breach or violation of the data use agreement, unless the covered entity took reasonable steps to cure the breach or end the violation, as applicable, and, if such steps were unsuccessful:
(A)(1) Discontinued disclosure of protected health information to the recipient; and
(A)(2) Reported the problem to the Secretary.
(B) A covered entity that is a limited data set recipient and violates a data use agreement will be in noncompliance with the standards, implementation specifications, and requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.

**Status**: Not Satisfied

**Reason**:

* The requirement explicitly states that a covered entity must take reasonable steps to cure the breach or end the violation if they know of a pattern of activity or practice by the limited data set recipient. However, there is no evidence provided in the text that the organization has taken such steps.
* Although the policy mentions establishing rigorous compliance with laws and regulations, it does not specifically address the requirement for reasonable steps to be taken to cure breaches or end violations.
* The lack of specific details on how the organization will implement this requirement suggests that it may not be fully addressed.

**Target Policy**: This policy further aims to establish rigorous compliance with 
relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards regarding data protection and 
information security, including but not limited to privacy regulations and sector-specific 
requirements.

(iv) A covered entity may not make fundraising communications to an individual under this paragraph where the individual has elected not to receive such communications under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.
